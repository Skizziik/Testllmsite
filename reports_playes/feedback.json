    "question": "What animal gives you wool for a bed?",
    "answer": "In Minecraft, sheep are the animals that provide wool, which can be used to craft beds. Here's a simple breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Farming Sheep**: Find or breed sheep in your Minecraft world. They typically spawn in plains, forest, and taiga biomes.\n\n2. **Shearing Wool**: Right-click a sheep with shears to shear it. This will drop one or two wool items.\n\n3. **Crafting the Bed**: Place 10 wool items (any color) and 1 iron ingot in a crafting table to create a bed. The pattern looks like this:\n   - Top row: Wool, Wool\n   - Middle row: Iron Ingot, Wool\n   - Bottom row: Wool, Wool\n\n4. **Placing the Bed**: Once crafted, you can place the bed anywhere in your world and use it as a block of rest for experience points (XP) and health regeneration.\n\nSo, sheep are the key to getting wool for crafting beds in Minecraft.",
    "rating": "negative",
    "comment": "The answer is partially correct.\n\nSuggested answer: Sheep give wool in Minecraft.\nYou can shear a sheep with shears to get wool without killing it.\nWool is used to make a bed, which lets you sleep and skip the night.",
