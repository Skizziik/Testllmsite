Then, connect the receiver oscillator and the output of the transmission line to a comparator in subtraction mode. If the received waveform is different from the receiver oscillator waveform, the comparator will generate a blinking signal at its output. You can connect the transmission line to different receivers with different frequencies, and don't forget to match the timing. The receiver circuit might get bulky, but this system allows you to spend much less redstone on the transmission line, if you have the transmitter and the receiver far away from each other. Analog telegraph uses up to 16 states of a redstone wire, instead of just two. Animation on the left is pretty self-explanatory: connect the repeaters as shown. The distance between the matching repeaters should be exactly 15. # First you need to make a building, at smallest 16 blocks by 5 blocks, and if you want, you can make it look like a realistic building in real life, such as a post office. # Next, make a long hole in a wall. It must be 12 blocks long for a building 16 by 5 (If you made a building bigger, leave four blocks on the wall or make space somewhere else). You must have space for four blocks. # Place repeaters along the hole on full delay. # Hook up to a redstone clock (the bigger the better). A good way to save space is to go up and down repeatedly in rows. That will be the storer. # The next thing to build is the sender. Place a lever on one of the spaces. So that you can remember that this is the sender, it is recommended to place a sign on top of the lever saying sender. # After that, make a line of repeaters on full delay to the other telegraph office (A good way to do this is to go back and forth between solid blocks and repeaters).

The strength of the input signal in these circuits usually doesn't matter. When an input or output supplies a redstone signal, it is usually just referred to as \"on\", and when there is no signal, it is referred to as \"off\". For example, an AND gate takes two redstone signals as input, and outputs a redstone signal only if both inputs are greater than 0. That is, an AND gate is on only when both inputs are on. In electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in Minecraft, all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results. A NOT gate (aka \"inverter\") is on if its input is off. The simplest NOT gate is an input signal with a redstone torch attached. An OR gate is on if any of its inputs are on. The simplest OR gate is to feed multiple input signals together into a single block or redstone wire. A NOR gate is on only if none of its inputs are on. The simplest NOR gate is to feed multiple input signals into a block with a redstone torch attached. An AND gate is on only if all of its inputs are on. The simplest AND gate is to add redstone torches in front of each input to a NOR gate. A NAND gate is on if any of its inputs are off. The simplest NAND gate is to remove the final redstone torch from an AND gate. An XOR gate is on if its inputs are different. An XNOR gate is on if its inputs are equal. An IMPLY gate is on unless the first input is on and the second input is off. A pulse circuit produces a redstone signal for a specified amount of time, changes the duration of an input signal, or reacts to signals of a particular duration.

The spawning mechanics differ between Java and Bedrock editions. In both editions, they spawn in the Overworld above a player whose \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days). This statistic is reset when the player dies or enters a bed. This does not require skipping the night. Furthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that blocks light in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but glass does not, as its light opacity is 0. Phantoms do not spawn above players in Spectator mode, but they do spawn above players in Creative mode. Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap. Phantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5. Phantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters. However, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds, the phantom appears somewhere in a 21×15×21 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.

It is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time. Taming depends on the mule's \"temper\". Mules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the mule. While riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed. Like all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. Like their real-life counterparts, mules in Minecraft cannot produce offspring. The only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey. Feeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; baby mules normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health. The table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat. To feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press on the mule. If the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule. Mules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. Mules have three \"equine stats\" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the mule is born or spawned, and are not affected by food. When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands or using spawn eggs – mules are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type. A mule's health ranges from 15–30, but tends toward the average of 22–23. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A mule with a non-even number of health points (15, 17, ",

The top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow. Because bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar cane, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use. While water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid. Bamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas. Bamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 1 bamboo block (not a bamboo shoot) is within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements. At this point, the player can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby. Bamboo can be used as fuel for smelting. Each bamboo item smelts 0.25 items. Bamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency. By crafting a Block of Bamboo (9 bamboo) into 2 bamboo planks, 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency. , the fuel efficiency can be further doubled by crafting the bamboo planks into twice the amount of slabs. Bamboo can be placed in a flower pot, where it retains the design it has in its item form. The appearance of bamboo changes as it grows. When first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot that has no hitbox. When it grows one block taller, its visual thickness increases to 2×2 pixels and the top block has leaves. At 3 blocks tall, the top two blocks have leaves. At 4 blocks tall, the bamboo's visual thickness expands to 3×3 pixels. At 5 blocks tall, the top three blocks have leaves on them, and these blocks remain on top as the bamboo grows.",

If nobody is in the end, the first player enter the portal will make the chunks load, which will instantly kill that player. This landmine by itself is inefficient and non-lethal. It damages the landscape and deals little if any damage to players. It is easy to make by placing a pressure plate on a block and one or more TNT directly beneath. Stepping on the pressure plate will ignite the TNT. To make it more efficient, there are many variations players can use: If you want to protect the landscape, you can place 2 water sources at the bottom of the hole. Place a slab at the bottom as sand/ gravel may quench the water source. This method will reduce the dealt damage, however. This is well disguised next to a door; the player may think it is to open the door. By digging a pit underneath it, the player might fall into it. Try to camouflage the landmine by making it less noticeable, e.g. grow tall grass around it. Concrete powder cannot be used in this design, the concrete powder will harden into concrete upon contacting water and quench the water source. TNT, when activated normally, plays an audible hissing sound and waits for a few seconds before blowing up, which can give anyone plenty of time to escape a landmine placed on the ground. A much more dangerous landmine with instant activation can be built instead: # Dig a 3×3×3 hole in the ground, jump in, and stand on a corner. # On the center, place a block of dirt and a rail on top of it. # On the rail, place a minecart with TNT.

A hopper collects items dropped on top of it if the space above the hopper is occupied by a non-storage block or block with block tag , as well as items landing inside the hopper block itself, regardless of the block above. Items are gathered from the entire 1 block space above the hopper, meaning that items sitting on partial blocks such as soul sand directly above a hopper can be collected. It is also possible for a hopper to collect items from inside a full, solid block, a situation that might come from items rising up through solid blocks or being summoned. Item entities are not collected when they are outside of the collection area however; for example, items on top of a stone block directly above a hopper are not collected. Collected items are placed in the leftmost empty slot of a hopper's inventory. If there are multiple dropped items above the hopper, the hopper collects them in the order they entered the chunk containing the hopper. This can be observed by pushing items onto a locked hopper from an adjacent chunk: regardless of which item lands first, the hopper will always collect the one that entered the chunk the earliest. Hoppers usually check for dropped items every game tick and they can collect items even before they are picked up by a player or destroyed by lava.

Dark forests feature a much higher density of trees compared to other forest biomes, which oftentimes blocks direct view of the sky entirely. Oak, dark oak, and sometimes birch trees generate in these biomes, with leaf litter frequently lying beneath the trees. It is the only place where dark oak trees naturally generate. Bee nests are not generated with trees. Additionally, both types of huge mushrooms generate among the trees, though the red variants are more common. Unlike regular forests, wolves do not spawn in dark forests. Unique to dark forests (and pale gardens) are woodland mansions, enormous dungeon-like structures that rarely generate within the trees. Woodland mansions are home to the dangerous illager mobs and are one of the only places where said mobs spawn. Mansions contain various rooms and valuable loot. The dark forest has a unique sky color and atmospheric effects with Vibrant Visuals, which is slightly more gray and faded than other biomes. Survival in dark forests may be more challenging than in other grassy biomes, as the dense shade provided by the dark oak trees allows hostile mobs to persist even throughout daytime. However, the biome offers plenty of logs, even more so than regular forests. Dark forests generate in areas with medium temperature and very high humidity values and are usually bordered by birch forests, but they can also border jungles. Dark forests border old growth taigas but not regular taigas. At higher elevations, dark forests give way to pale gardens, groves, jagged peaks and frozen peaks. In coastal areas they border regular oceans.
