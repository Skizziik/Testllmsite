The donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.

Mobs can spawn anywhere in this range that is suitable, with mobs more likely to spawn closer to the monster spawner than farther away. While mobs are spawned at fractional x and z-coordinates (i.e. not aligned to blocks), they are spawned at an integer y-coordinate. Horizontally, a mob can spawn with its center point anywhere within range, but vertically, mobs spawn with their legs at either the same layer as the monster spawner block, one block above it, or one block below it. (Note that when there are other blocks slightly intersecting the mob's hitbox, they can sometimes glitch further away - often up - but this does not make it a true spawning point.) A monster spawner attempts to spawn 4 mobs at randomly chosen points within the spawning volume, then waits anywhere from 200 to 799 ticks (10 to 39.95 seconds) before spawning again.

There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19. When worn, golden leggings provide armor points. As with other pieces of gold armor, piglins do not attack players wearing golden leggings unless provoked or attacked. Piglins are also attracted towards golden leggings on the ground and equip them after inspecting them. Two damaged golden leggings can be combined through crafting or using the grindstone. The durability of the used golden leggings are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either leggings. (except curse enchantments) Two pair of golden leggings can also be combined in an anvil. Unlike using a grindstone or crafting, using an anvil preserves the enchantments on the leggings, but costs experience. Golden leggings can also be repaired in an anvil by adding gold ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the leggings maximum durability, rounded down. This preserves the leggings enchantments, but costs experience. Golden leggings have an enchantability value of 25. Leggings can receive the following enchantments: It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, leggings, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli",

As the name implies, old growth spruce taigas include trees that have attained a great age, and therefore great height. Spruce grows all over the landscape, and most of them are the large 2×2 trees that grow significantly taller than regular trees. Much of the grass blocks are replaced by large swathes of podzol and coarse dirt. Additionally, rocks made of mossy cobblestone frequently generate on the ground and dead bushes generate alongside the sweet berry bushes, ferns, large ferns, and short grass on the ground. Mushrooms are more common here than most Overworld biomes. Trail ruins may generate here. Chestnut wolves, foxes and rabbits may spawn here. As the climate here is cold, rainfall changes to snowfall above layer Y=160±8. There are overall more trees in old growth spruce taigas compared to normal taigas, leading to increased foliage density. This makes wood more abundant, though as a large portion of it grows as part of tall 2×2 spruce trees, it may be more difficult to obtain. Old growth spruce taigas are slightly more difficult for survival than regular taigas for this reason, though aren't so bad once acclimated and strategies are used to clear the tall trees; they may offer more unique views compared to regular taigas as well. These biomes generate at very high humidity, moderately low temperature and negative weirdness. They border normal taigas, dark forests, groves, swamps, and windswept forests. Old growth spruce taigas can border snowy taigas, but only do at the tops of a plateau. At higher elevations they transition to groves and jagged peaks. Due to their very high humidity values, old growth taigas are almost guaranteed to have lush caves generate beneath them; however, if the old growth spruce taiga generated far inland, dripstone caves may generate under the old growth taiga instead.

When attacking, an enderman may teleport up to 19 blocks horizontally and 22 blocks vertically to close the distance on a target. Teleportation attempts made to attack a target choose a random destination within a 9×11×9 rectangular prism centered on a point 16 blocks horizontally and 17 blocks vertically toward its target. If the target is within those ranges, the destination is centered on the target's XZ and/or Y coordinates instead. Both teleportation types then apply the following checks: As long as the selected block is not movement-blocking, seek downward. If the found block is waterlogged, the teleportation attempt fails. Starting again with the originally selected target, seek downward as long as the block below is not movement-blocking. The teleportation attempt succeeds if no liquid or solid blocks prevent them from standing at the destination. Thus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is movement-blocking. Endermen can appear to teleport further than their maximum teleport distance when teleporting downward, as distance through air is not a factor when seeking downward for a valid location. Blocks that have a large enough collision box but are not movement-blocking, such as carpet that is not above a movement-blocking block, snow layers 10 or more deep, and azalea, can be used to prevent teleportation. Endermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.

However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero. Enchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 level could be spent to enchant a book or a different tool to refresh the list. The possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1–30). The following actions do not affect the possible enchantments: removing the item and putting it back in clicking on the item slot with a different item using a different item of the same type and material replacing or moving the table (but keeping the same number of bookshelves) using a different table with the same number of bookshelves, or replacing or rearranging the bookshelves without changing their total number. Changing the enchantment levels offered by adding, removing, or blocking bookshelves alters the enchantments shown, but does not change possible enchantments; using another enchanting table with the previous bookshelf number still shows the previous enchantments. The enchantments for a particular enchantment level (with the same seed and item) do also differ depending on which row they appear in, but they are not \"better\" or \"worse\" based on the row despite the different resource costs.

This video by mooing_cowmilk provides an overview of most CUD designs, and also includes an explanation of them. This method uses the mechanics of a chest. When a chest is locked, the comparator doesn't realize that it shouldn't be turned on anymore. When the player updates the comparator, it realizes and resets the system. It's also possible to block the chest with an ocelot or cat. When an ocelot sits on a chest, the player can't open it. The player can move it using pistons, minecarts, or water. Using minecarts, players can make a silent CUD (besides the meow sound). This method uses a filled cauldron that is being pushed by a piston. The comparator doesn't notice that the cauldron has been pushed down and stays powered until it gets an update. Note that the cauldron should contain water. This method is often used in BUDs. The player can turn any repeater-based BUD into a CUD by replacing the repeater with a comparator. They can redirect redstone with a detector rail, redstone block, or a solid block, blocking 2 redstone diagonal to each other. Again, the comparator doesn't realize that the redstone isn't pointing the right direction anymore, and it will stay turned on until it receives an update. Comparators can take a redstone output from an item frame, but only if the item frame's position isn't occupied by a block. Many blocks will break the item frame if they are in the same position, but some blocks don't. Examples are water, fence gates, skulls, and flowers. Other devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the CUD switch. CUDs can be made stackable and even tile-able. They can be turned into a toggle-CUD. CUDs can be made pistonless using ocelots. A T-CUD toggles between 2 states.",
