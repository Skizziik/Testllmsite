Villages naturally generate with stables and animal pens containing horses. Each horse variant has unique features and markings, and a baby version. Adult horses are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Baby horses start at half the size of adults, and , get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, horses do not change appearance once they have been tamed, although tamed horses may be differentiated by giving them equipment. Horses can have 1 of 7 base colors: white, creamy, chestnut, brown, black, gray, and dark brown; and 1 of 5 marking patterns: no markings, white stockings and blaze, white field, white spots and black dots.

The fox sits for a short time, then hops back up. Foxes sit down even when attached to a lead or in a boat. Foxes that have not been bred by the player always sit while in the Nether, even while attached to a lead. If any item is on the ground near a fox, it travels to the item and picks it up, and the item appears in the fox's mouth. However, usually a fox chooses to attack a mob over picking up an item. This behavior is not limited to food and animal products; a fox can pick up any item that the player can pick up. However, they prefer to pick up food items, and if they have already picked up non-food items, they drop the non-food items to pick up food instead. A fox can also swap a food item it is holding for a different food item. A fox eats any food item it picks up (besides cake) after 30 seconds and the fox is affected by any side effects from the food, such as poison or teleportation. For example, if a fox eats an enchanted golden apple, it obtains the Absorption, Resistance, Fire Resistance and Regeneration. If a fox eats any type of soup or stew, an empty bowl is dropped. If a fox eats a chorus fruit, it teleports accordingly. If there is a stage 3 or 4 sweet berry bush within a 16 block radius of a fox, it sprints toward the bush and eats the sweet berries, dropping the item it was holding. However, if the fox stands on a solid block directly above the sweet berry bush and is already holding an item, the fox will harvest the sweet berries, making them drop, but will not eat them nor drop the item it was holding.

Obsidian drops itself when it's destroyed. 8 obsidian blocks are dropped by an ender chest when broken without a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Obsidian is formed when flowing water touches a lava source block, and it can be found naturally where water from a spring or aquifer has flowed over a nearby lava pool. This provides a renewable way of obtaining obsidian, as lava can be farmed via cauldrons under pointed dripstone. Obsidian is created when a Nether portal is generated in the Nether or the Overworld. This portal can then be mined, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. , if a Nether portal is generated midair, 4 extra obsidian is generated at the bottom of the portal. When an entity enters the End via an End portal, it always spawns on a platform consisting of 25 obsidian. This platform can then be mined, and regenerates whenever an entity enters the End, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. Obsidian pillars also regenerate when the ender dragon respawns. Obsidian generates naturally in all dimensions: Obsidian generates as part of ruined portals.

A furnace runs at a speed of one item every or six items per minute. The number of items that a fuel source can process depends on the type of fuel. As soon as the process begins, the fuel slot is decremented immediately, and that unit of fuel starts burning. The fuel continues burning until fully consumed, regardless of whether the upper slot has any items remaining to process. For example, a piece of coal burns for 80 seconds and can process eight items, but if only one item is processed (or if the item is pulled out before the process is complete), the coal still continues burning for the full 80 seconds, wasting seven items’ worth of processing.

Keep in mind that the unloader receives two distinct output items (shulker boxes and other items being sucked out of them), meaning one should build a system that sorts that output. The player might not find unloaders as useful, but they still have practical purposes. If the player's base has a storage system, then the player can come back from a long journey and dump an inventory-full of shulker boxes with various valuables into a chest. A system could then unload the shulker boxes and sort out the contents. In an automatic tree farm, several shulker boxes with bone meal can be unloaded gradually to be used. In a printer, especially 3D, it is easiest to program using shulker boxes to “write” the instructions and a shulker box unloader to “read” the instructions. Minecarts with hoppers have an unique property - they can take 20 items away from container blocks every second, allowing one to create exceedingly fast shulker box unloaders, while still preserving shulker boxes. Be careful about the performance impact as minecarts with hoppers may cause a lot of lag, as they constantly check for various things every tick. There are also unloaders that burn shulker box items instead, causing them to instantly spit out its contents, which then get sorted by the system, however, in exchange of performance impact, this doesn't preserve shulker boxes, but with the existence of shulker farms, this method is more convenient. Hoppers are laggy redstone components and locking them when the unloader is idle can benefit the performance.

Trial chambers are also the only place where breezes spawn, whose breeze rods can be used to craft wind charges. Various materials such as heavy cores and certain armor trims are obtained exclusively by unlocking vaults in trial chambers. As it is the only source of breeze rods and heavy cores, the structure is also the location where maces are obtained. Ominous trials can also take place here through Bad Omen, where Trial Omen causes all trial spawners to become ominous, making them more difficult and providing greater rewards. Trial chambers generate underground in the Overworld. The starting room generates at an altitude of between Y=-40 and -20, but the structure is not restricted to those Y levels. In fact, the majority of the structure's rooms tend to generate between Y=-20 and 0. Trial chambers can only generate in new chunks, specifically ones that did not exist prior to Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0. The generation of trial chambers follows a grid of 34×34 chunk regions centered on the world origin (X=0, Z=0). There is always one trial chambers structure generated in each region at a random location, unless a deep dark biome cancels the generation of the trial chambers.

Unlike regular fire, a campfire's fire does not spread under any circumstances. Campfires are lit by default when placed. A campfire can be manually lit by flint and steel on it (either by player or by dispenser), a fire charge on it, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when is true. , campfires can also be lit by an item enchanted with Fire Aspect, or stepping on it while burning. A campfire can be extinguished by waterlogging it (placing water in the same block space), throwing a splash water bottle on it, or a shovel on it. Campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face. , campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire. As with torches, rain does not extinguish campfires. Using flint and steel on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead. Campfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a hay bale is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.

Once you know the basics of redstone music, you can make a virtually infinite number of songs. Use a redstone signal to play the sound Right-click to change the pitch of the note block Remember that redstone dust activates any blocks it points to as well as all the blocks it is placed on. Always remember that you need a block of space above a note block. Be careful with water as it destroys many redstone components on contact. If you have a lot of redstone, it might be helpful to color code or label what part does what in case it breaks. You can use pistons to start/stop the song. You can use buttons to start/stop instead of levers. It is possible to make a song with a certain section that keeps repeating until a signal comes through and moves to the next thing. This is achievable by making a closed circuit using redstone, repeaters, and note blocks, and use a hopper timer to time when to open the circuit and continue the song. By placing repeaters and note blocks in lines, it is possible to play multiple times. Another way is to put note blocks under detector rails, so as you ride along you can play the song of your choice! When making redstone music in vanilla Minecraft, it's very helpful to know how you can translate sheet music you find online into an actual note block circuit. The main two factors of music are rhythm and pitch. Rhythm is determined by how many repeaters you put before/after a note block, and how many ticks you set them to, and pitch is determined by how many times you right click a note block. Once you know how rhythm and pitches relate to ticks and note blocks, you can make an infinite number of songs. Pitch is one of the most important factors of music.

The eye of ender's flying function works only in the Overworld and only if a stronghold exists or can generate in the world. It does nothing in the Nether, the End, or custom dimensions, unless a structure able to generate in that dimension has been added to the #minecraft:eye_of_ender_located structure tag. Note that the eyes may point to an incorrect location if the target chunks were generated with a different biomes map in an older vers",

When generating, the edge of black and white part of noise image becomes air, making it look like long and thin noodles. Noise pillars look like large dripstones or speleothems, but consist usually of stone. They can be found in any type of noise cave, making caves more realistic. Aquifers are liquid systems used to generate bodies of liquids in a world. Almost all liquids in a world (including those in carvers, noise caves, rivers, and oceans) are generated by aquifers. Aquifers may create underground liquid bodies that look like lakes, as well as water or lava waterfalls. Note that lava lakes are also generated underground, but are not aquifers. Aquifers below Y=0 may sometimes generate with lava instead of water, with aquifers from y=-55 to -63 always consisting of lava. If two liquid bodies of different levels or types are too close, some blocks may be generated between them to separate them. Carver caves' structure typically consists of a series of irregular tunnels branching off and winding in other directions, which may cut through to the surface, creating natural entrances to the cave. A carver cave may have a main room (aka circular void) connecting 1 to 4 trunks, each trunk with zero or two branches. It may also have no main room, only one trunk and zero or two branches on it, that is, an I-shaped or T-shaped cave. There is a one-in-four probability of generating a cave with the main room, and another three-quarters probability of generating an I-shaped or T-shaped cave. The main room is an ellipsoidal void of various size. It sometimes may be too small to be found, making the cave looks I-shaped or T-shaped. But as long as the cave is not I-shaped or T-shaped, it must have a main room. For each trunk or branch,",

A single redstone repeater is generated naturally in each jungle pyramid. 8-13 redstone repeaters can also generate in ancient cities. A redstone repeater can be used in four different ways: to \"repeat\" redstone signals back to full strength, delay signals, prevent signals moving backward, or to \"lock\" signals in one state. A repeater can be placed only on top of full blocks (dirt, stone, etc.), on top of upside-down slabs, upside-down stairs, furnaces, and glass. , a repeater can also be placed on fences and stone walls. They can also be placed on some transparent blocks. See Opacity/Placement for more information. To place a repeater, use the control. A redstone repeater has a front and back – the arrow on the top points to the repeater's front. A repeater also has two small redstone torches on its top – the color of the torches indicates whether its output is on (dark red when off, bright red when on) and the distance between them indicates the delay the repeater adds to the signal transmission. A repeater is 0.125 () blocks high. A repeater transmits signals only from its back to its front, but its behavior can be modified from the side (see signal locking, below).
