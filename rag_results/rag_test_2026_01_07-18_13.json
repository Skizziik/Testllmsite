This form is the last he is shown to take, and potentially his final if left behind. Romeo is somewhat mentally unstable, as noted by Jesse in Giant Consequences; and is very capricious and erratic, as seen when he threatens to burn the Sunshine Institute to the ground simply because Jesse does not obey when he tries to pit them against Jack/Petra.

They can generate in all three dimensions, and are intentional. In the Overworld, the floors of erosions are always replaced with stone. They expose ores such as coal ore, copper ore and iron ore. In badlands erosions, gold ore can also be seen. Erosions in The Nether replace the floor with netherrack. Nether erosions can expose ore such as nether gold ore and nether quartz ore. Because erosions generate independent of the y-axis, if an erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang. Since erosions generate before features, chorus plants can take root in End erosions. The floor of End erosions is always end stone. When the game generates new chunks, the surface depth is calculated for every column inside the chunk based on the minecraft:surface noise. This value is an integer, and when it is less than or equal to 0, the top block from the surface is replaced with air. Note that because surface depth is calculated per-column, every surface in the column is removed; that is, an identical erosion appears above or below another one if there is an overhang. The surface depth rarely reaches these values, eliciting the rarity of erosions. After the hole is generated, the floor is replaced with a stone block of the respective dimension, and the hole is flooded with water if it is at or below sea level. Erosion generation occurs before carver creation in the terrain generation process, meaning that caves, features, and structures can disrupt or even completely conceal them.

Solid blocks are significantly different from liquid or gas blocks, through which entities can freely pass. Mobs require a solid top surface to spawn. Some mobs are able to spawn inside of the space occupied by another block, but only if their hitbox does not intersect the collision of any solid block. Players, mobs, and other entities can walk on top of solid blocks. Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles or water drip particles) also collide with solid blocks. If a solid block's collision box is a full cube that is solid on all sides, it is known as a full block. For example, stone, planks, and glass are full blocks, but stairs, fences, and chests are not. For most blocks, it's easy to tell whether they're full blocks or not, but some are not so obvious: Cauldrons and composters are not full blocks because their top face is not fully solid. Scaffolding is not a full block because although its interaction box occupies the full block, its collision box does not. Dirt path and farmland are not full blocks because they are slightly shorter than a full block. Mud and soul sand are not full blocks despite visually appearing to be because their collision boxes are shorter than their models, so entities standing on top \"sink into\" the blocks. Whether or not a block is a full block can influence some game mechanics. For example, endermen will only place blocks on top of full blocks and hoppers will not try to collect item entities if their top face is covered by a full block.

Smithing tables can be broken by hand, but using an axe is faster. Smithing tables drop themselves when destroyed. Smithing tables can spawn naturally within toolsmith houses in villages. Smithing tables can also generate in trail ruins. Regardless of the player's position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the hammers are facing west and east, while the dark grey side is always facing up). A smithing table is primarily used for upgrading diamond gear to netherite gear and for trimming armor. The smithing interface is accessed by pressing on a smithing table. To work at a smithing table, the player must provide a smithing template in the left-most slot, a tool or piece of armor in the central slot, and an augmenting material in the right-most slot. Applying a smithing template costs no experience, and preserves item data such as durability consumption, enchantments, and custom names. Upgrading to netherite requires a netherite upgrade smithing template, a diamond tool or a piece of diamond armor, and a netherite ingot. Decorative trims can be applied to any piece of armor, including turtle shells, by using an armor trim smithing template and a trim material. After trimming, the armor will show a decorative pattern corresponding to the smithing template with the color determined by the used material. A preview of this pattern can be seen on an armor stand model, located on the right side of smithing table's GUI. If a smithing table has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to toolsmith and claim the smithing table as their job site block.

The random selector (right) depends on the random flight of an item from a dropper. The input (button) in this random selector turns off the torch, deactivating the piston. It also powers a redstone dust directed into the block, powering the repeater and activating the dropper. The piston then reactivates to push the stuck item (if any). A hopper collects the item and puts it back into the dropper, activating a comparator. NOTE: The dropper must be facing up. If facing down, the item glitches out of the machine. Earliest Known Publication: 24 September 2014 An old kind of random selector is the \"chicken randomizer\", which uses a chicken walking on multiple pressure plates in a containment chamber. For this and other improved randomizers, view the randomizers tutorial. Another way to construct a random selector is to feed the output of a digital randomizer into a demuxer. You can create a 1-bit digital randomizer from an analog 2-RNG by discarding one of the outputs, and then combine N of them for an N-bit digital randomizer. A thyristor is a bit like a D flip-flop but has a different functionality. It has two inputs: the \"gate\" line G and the \"anode\" line A, and has one output: the \"cathode\" line K. When triggered by G, the circuit sets its output K to A if A is high, then holds that output state until A goes low. Otherwise K stays low. Design A is the simplest form of the circuit. The hopper is initially empty so K stays low regardless of whether A is high or low. When G goes high, the item in the dropper moves to the hopper so K goes high as well. The hopper is suspended by A so as long as A is high, the item doesn't go back to the dropper so K is kept high. But there is a downside to this design. When triggered by G while A is low, a 1 tick on-pulse is emitted from K. Design B is an improved form at the cost of complexity / size / delay. There is a",

When the input turns on, the outputs turn on in order (e.g., A then B), but when the input turns off, the outputs turn off in reverse order (e.g., B then A). The timing of the output activation and deactivation can be changed by adjusting the delay on the repeaters. All of these designs can be extended indefinitely. Earliest Known Publication: 5 July 2011 (basic concept), 20 June 2012 (Floor ABBA), and 18 July 2012 (Ceiling ABBA). The block update detector switch, or simply BUD, detects any time an adjacent block receives an update. An update is anything that changes that block's state: block placed, destroyed, door opened, repeater delay changed, cake eaten, grass growing, snow falling, furnace used (or turns off), and so on (chests opened and crafting tables used do not cause updates, sleeping in a bed does). When a block is updated, all adjacent blocks are also eligible for an update, and this can be used to produce a redstone signal or for other purposes. BUDs have been used for all kinds of things, from traps to detecting daylight to locking mechanisms on hidden doors. Current BUD switches take advantage of a quirk where pistons can receive power, but not updates, from blocks adjacent to the space the piston head occupies when extended. That is: blocks adjacent to the extended state and not adjacent to the retracted state provide power to extend the piston, but as they are not adjacent to the retracted state do not cause the piston to update when that power state changes. There are many models of auto resetting BUDs. This is done by having the firing of the BUD switch somehow cause the BUD switch to restore the pre-fired state often when fired it cuts the power to the piston, allowing it to retract. This is done either by extra circuitry or, as in the example below, by the properties of blocks themselves. Version 1.1",

Many tutorials will want the reader to build an ALU first, and therefore the topic is covered very widely around the internet. The ALU we will be building can perform four important operations on two inputs and return a correct output. A, B, being both 8-bit inputs A >> (bitshift A right (the same as binary divide by 2)) 2 so 5 × = 1010002; five is bumped up by three. So now, one in your new system would be 1 × = 10002 and that would leave room for 0.1, 0.01 or 0.001; 0.01 * = 102. This leads to a more complicated setup for your computer. The subtraction of numbers is surprisingly simple. The ALU first must change the second number (the value subtracting by) and convert it from a positive number to a negative number. A two's complement is when you invert the binary number (so that all the 0s are 1s and 1s are 0s) and add one to it. Example: do 10 subtract 9 This poses the complexity of signed numbers. This is a weight to the binary number to assign it as a positive or negative number. Whether the result is a negative or positive number is determined by the overflow flag. If there is an overflow, this means that the number is positive and otherwise, negative. To implement this, you can ask the ALU to do 3 operations. To do A subtract B, the operations are Multiplication is repeated addition, so the easiest (inefficiently) is to add A to a variable B amount of times. Here's pseudomachine code for it JUMP IF (B > 0) TO LINE 2 However, there are more efficient ways of multiplication. A good method is to repeatedly bitshift the first number to the location of ea",

A melon drops 3–7 melon slices when broken by hand, using tools, or pushing with a piston. Silk Touch causes the block itself to drop. Fortune increases the maximum number of melon slices dropped, increasing the average yield to 6.4314 with Fortune III. The actual amount is capped at 9, so Fortune III simply increases the chance of getting 9 slices, which is sufficient to craft the melon again from the slices. Melons are naturally generated in jungle biomes, as a pile (and in some farms) in savanna villages and inside tillage rooms of woodland mansions. An enderman holding a melon drops the block upon death. Melon seeds can be planted, placing a small stem that grows over time. Once the stem reaches maturity, it attempts to generate a melon block in one of the four immediately adjacent blocks; however, this attempt may fail if the chosen adjacent block is not empty or the block beneath is not an appropriate block (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, pale moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots). Melons take 10 to 30 minutes to grow, which is equal to 0.5 to 1.5 times the length of a daylight cycle. Once a stem has produced a melon, that stem does not produce any further melons until the existing melon is harvested. Melon stems connect only to the melons they produce. For example, if stem A generates a melon adjacent to stem B, stem B does not connect and can still produce another melon. Similarly, if a melon is placed adjacent to stem B, stem B would still be able to produce another melon. The same principle applies for pumpkins. Melons require a light level of 9 or higher to grow.

The numbers you see on top are the tempo of the music, which is how many beats there are in a minute, with the assumption that the quarter note gets the beat. Finally, numbers with a .5 are unobtainable with repeaters alone. The easiest way to get them is to use a sticky piston with a redstone block attached, which has a delay of 1.5 ticks. Any other fraction has no exact match. This would result in sixtuplet sixteenth notes instead of straight sixteenth notes. (A sixtuplet sixteenth note is a quarter note broken into 6 evenly spaced notes). If you must have your song in a tempo where eighth note triplets have no exact match, you can substitute for 2 sixteenth notes followed by an eighth note, which sound similar to triplets at faster tempos. Follow these steps so that you can make a sound similar to a train whistle: # Place a button on the ground. Place redstone behind the button. Then, place a redstone piece on either side of the first redstone; one on the left, and one on the right. # Place 3 repeaters, set to no delay, behind the redstone, facing away from you, so that if the redstone were to be powered, the repeaters would pick up the signal. # Dig out the 3 blocks behind the repeaters and replace them with clay, so that when the note block is on top of the block, it emits a flute sound. # Place note blocks on top of the clay. Right-click one 8 times, another 12 times, and the final one 16 times. # Place 3 repeaters, side by side behind the note blocks, and set them to full delay, or 4 ticks.

While Soul Speed walkways are not as fast as some other means of transit (such as blue ice tracks), Soul Speed boots do not require vehicles such as minecarts or boats in order to apply their speed boost. This makes Soul Speed walkways useful for increasing movement speed across more uneven or varied terrain where vehicles might prove unwieldy. Carpets or slabs on top of soul sand or soul soil does not prevent the speed increase from Soul Speed. The durability of worn boots enchanted with Soul Speed has a 4% chance to go down for each compatible block stepped on. This chance can be decreased with the Unbreaking enchantment. Expected compatible blocks stepped on before boots reach zero durability at each Unbreaking level. Soul particles appear when walking on one of the compatible blocks. The tag determines which blocks are compatible with Soul Speed.",

A submerged object ascends toward the water's surface. If the water is flowing, the object is pushed along with it. Hoppers draw in any items that are placed above them if they are not powered by redstone. Items can either stack up to 64 or 16, or not stack at all: Most items can stack to 64.

If a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event or replaceitem command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs. This is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.

If the charge connects, it deals to damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of knockback to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall. As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way. If a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first.

The MASIC computer aims to be a one-size-fits-all computer and does not specialize in one task, so it is fully programmable by reading its own memory (explained in Section 2: instruction sets). The simple I/O is great for multipurpose use and the memory is sufficiently sized. It runs at quite a fast speed (because of its small size). Decoders convert binary figures into decimals.

This is the design for the address decoder we are going to build. Above is a simple 2-bit state, so it has two inputs (left and right) through the repeaters. The output is the redstone line above which will turn OFF when the state is met. The state is whether the redstone input will turn OFF the redstone line above; if so, the state is the redstone inputs. In the above case, the left must be turned OFF (0) and the right (blue) must be turned ON (1) to yield an OFF on the top redstone line. So it expects a state of OFF ON (aka 01 for binary). They are colored blue for bits which should be ON (1) for it to stop powering the top redstone line. Once every bit stops powering the redstone line, it then turns off. These are basically either one or two NOT gates feeding into a OR gate and then NOT the output. Above is an 8-bit state, it expects 8 inputs in exactly the order 0000 1101.

When a player kills a mob that is in combat with one or more axolotls, axolotls remove Mining Fatigue from the player, and give the player Regeneration I for per axolotl in the fight, up to a duration of , and uncapped . Axolotls attack the following mobs, dealing points of damage per attack: After killing a non-hostile mob, there is a two minute cooldown before another non-hostile mob can be hunted. Axolotls prioritize attacking hostile mobs over non-hostile mobs. If an axolotl takes damage underwater, it may play dead, dropping to the ground for while gaining Regeneration I. Hostile aquatic mobs ignore healing axolotls. There is a chance for an axolotl to play dead to recover . In addition, if either a random integer from 0–2 (inclusive) is less than the amount of incoming damage, or the axolotl's health before the damage is dealt is less than 50% of its maximum health, it plays dead. Axolotls can leave the water and wander about on land.",

Players can create an enchanted book by enchanting a book on an enchantment table.

It has the smallest initial space requirement for growth, and along with dark oaks, its leaves have a chance to drop an apple. As with birches and cherries, an oak grown near flowers can generate with a bee nest attached. There are three variants of the oak tree: small regular oaks, tall and branching fancy oaks, and swamp oaks. Oaks come in several variants with different properties: Small regular oaks are the most common. The leaves are arranged the same as the birch leaf arrangement. Fancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding logs surrounded by leaves. The sapling requires 4&ndash;14 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides. A fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6. Branches and outgrowths, however, require 8 blocks of open space directly above the sapling. An oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a \"brace\" of non-solid blocks (e.g. glass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground. A rare variant is colloquially known as a \"balloon\" oak. This is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible. It consists of a tall trunk and leaves that form a spherical shape, similar to a balloon. These oaks can grow around an obstructing block. They usually contain 4 blocks of logs, but some may contain more. In swamp biomes, naturally occurring swamp oaks tend to grow in the water.",

In total, there were thirty different sounds that could be played using copper horns. The sound a copper horn played was based on multiple conditions, which are in order as follows: If crouching, the bass tune was played. Else, if looking up (by 45 degrees), the harmony tune was played. Else, the melody tune was played. This shows what all the tracks for each arrangement sound like when played simultaneously.",

A furnace minecart can be made to pull up to four other minecarts. All minecarts in this train move at the constant speed of the furnace minecart. Trains are formed when a minecart is pushed into the back of a powered furnace minecart or a short-enough train. These shunts are fragile at best and easily come undone, but some methods are stronger than others. For example, pushing a minecart into a furnace minecart and then powering the furnace gives a weaker shunt than pushing the furnace minecart into the other minecart against a wall, and then powering the furnace in the other direction. Minecarts with furnaces can climb up steep inclines while pushing other minecarts as long as they have fuel. If a minecart with furnace reaches a slope while pulling another minecart, the pulled minecart is switched to the forward position so that it can be pushed along the slope instead of pulled. A high-speed minecart running into the back of a furnace minecart going in the same direction automatically creates a weak shunt with it, pulling it along. Pulling a minecart with TNT causes it to explode. When a train comes to a turn, the shunt comes undone with the pulled minecart jettisoned backward. The correct way to make such a turn is having the shunt undone before a turn, and then make the two rejoin on a straight rail later by having the pulled cart catch up with the minecart with furnace.

Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player. Some mobs, including passive and neutral animals, and even hoglins, have the ability to be bred by the player, creating offspring.

It spawns mobs in waves, ejects consumable items and/or trial keys after they are all defeated, and then deactivates for 30 minutes.

A trial spawner will convert into an active ominous trial spawner during an ominous trial, even if it was on cooldown. Trial spawner can be obtained only by using the Creative inventory, using or executing commands. Trial spawners generate naturally in every chamber and every corridor of trial chambers, except for the entrance chamber. No tool can accelerate the breaking process of trial spawner. Trial spawner drops nothing when it's destroyed. A trial spawner summons a limited number of mobs, scaled based on the number of nearby players. When these mobs are defeated, the spawner ejects a reward for each player and enters a cooldown period. A trial spawner has a required player range of 14 blocks. Any player in Survival or Adventure mode activates the spawner if the distance between the player's center and the spawner's center becomes less than the required player range, and the spawner has a direct line of sight to the player. Once activated, the spawner begins summoning copies of the mob set in it, and no longer requires the player to be within range or maintain line of sight. The line of sight check for trial spawners can pass through transparent solid blocks, such as copper grates and glass. This differs from the line of sight check for hostile mobs, which cannot pass through these blocks. Trial spawners do not activate if the game rule is , or if the difficulty is set to Peaceful.

This can all be implemented into an adder like so: A control bit is added to the circuit such that when it is on, the unit subtracts, and when it is off the unit adds. After this, add XOR gates between the control bit and each B input. Route the output of each XOR to the B input of each adder. Finally, to make the unit Two's compliment compatible, a final XOR gate must be added between the control bit and the carry out of the most significant bit. This is the simplest way to implement negatives and subtraction in a CPU, as it adds gracefully and store well in registers. If this is to be implemented in a calculator, simply subtract 1 from the output and then invert all the outputs except the most significant one. The most significant bit is on if the number is negative. In order to make a subtracter, simply invert one of the binary inputs (the 1st or 2nd number). If the number is negative, the answer comes out inverted. In real computers, the first bit (also called the sign) decides whether the number is positive or negative, if you include this (applying the same inverting rule) you can detect whether the number is negative, or if it is just a big number. In circuits, it might be useful to have a logic unit that determines which output is to be chosen based on its input. Such a unit can then be used for more complex circuits, such as an ALU. This is an example of a 2-bit logic unit having four states depending on the input. The outputs are in top row, with 11, 00, 01, 10 order (input order: first first, bottom second). This is another example of a simplified version using Gray codes. The output appears at the torches at the end of the top rows.

Then, if you set a delay of any number of ticks other than the default 1-tick delay on the repeater, it turns into a T-BUD. This process can also be reversed by setting the repeater back to its default 1-tick setting. (It only works since release of Redstone Blocks, though players could theoretically use a normal block and a redstone torch to mimic its effects.) An extremely compact one-time design that is easily hidden and therefore ideal for traps is as follows: Place a piston, a sticky piston is most useful, parallel to the ground. Place a block one block to any side except the piston head and one block above the piston. On the side of the block facing the piston, place a redstone torch. Then place a lever on any other side of the block and switch it on. The redstone torch will go out but the piston will remain extended. You can then break everything except for the piston, but make sure to break the lever after you break the torch. A block update will then cause the piston to retract, possibly pulling the floor out from under the victim. Remember, though, that after the detector is tripped, it has to be rebuilt to be used again. The design looks something like this: Or, for it being smaller: The player can make a 2×1 (3×1 when extended) BUD by having a 2 sticky pistons (stacked) both facing any direction except up and down, then on both of those sticky pistons add Redstone Blocks. Whenever a block is updated, (destroyed, placed etc.) it will switch the bottom piston outwards. Good for traps, as the BUD may need to be compact. The only con to this is that it has to be reset.

Each player has a warning level, which increases every time that player activates a naturally generated sculk shrieker. This is not specific to any sculk shrieker. A sculk shrieker that has already been activated by a player before activates the same way it does normally, and the warning level does not reset if the player were to activate a new sculk shrieker.

From Beta 1.4_01 up until its removal, locked chests could be broken instantly with any tool or by hand. In Beta 1.4, if the date is April 1st of any year, the game picks a random location to generate a locked chest in every new chunk. If the chosen location is air and has a solid block below, a locked chest generates. The server console outputs \"added a chest!!\" every time a locked chest generates. The locked chest's initial purpose was to direct players to the Minecraft store at the URL . Clicking the would result in the dialog box to the left being displayed. This functionality was exclusive to Beta 1.4; all later versions did not trigger this, and instead the block would disappear after a while, similar to leaves. Locked chests would decide their facing direction according to the blocks around them, generally making an attempt to face outward from walls. If their face was obstructed by a block, they would rotate accordingly to face away from said block. Prior to Beta 1.8, said behavior was standard for directional blocks such as chests and furnaces. From Beta 1.8 onward, said blocks would instead face toward the player placing them, and would not change their facing direction depending on nearby blocks. The locked chest, being an unsupported block, was not subject to this change, and retained its old behavior up until its removal, making it unique in this aspect. Locked chests could be used as fuel, lasting 1.5 items, the same as a regular chest. Locked chests can be placed under note blocks to produce the \"bass\" sound.",

If mined without Silk Touch, the block drops 1 emerald (or up to 4 with Fortune). If mined with a pickaxe with Silk Touch, the block drops itself. It also drops when broken. Emerald ore generates in mountains and windswept hills biomes in the form of ore features, and attempts to generate 100 times per chunk in blobs of 0–4 ores. Emerald ore can be exposed to the sky. Specifically, it can be found in the following biomes: Emerald ore generates from levels -16 to 320, having the greatest chance at level 232, and becoming less common toward either end of the range. However, because there is little to no terrain in the upper half of that range in regular worlds, the actual emerald ore quantity peaks around level 90 as seen in the empirical distribution graph below. Emerald ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Emerald ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate emerald ore, which is the rarest ore in Minecraft, rarer than normal emerald ore and ancient debris, even rarer than its second-place competitor, (normal) diamond ore. It generates only between the altitudes of -16 and 8 where deepslate naturally occurs, which happens to be toward the end of emerald ore distribution where it is extremely rare; its limitation to certain biomes further adds to its rarity.

The repair does not need to be complete; one material repairs of the item's maximum durability. Repair of an unenchanted item can cost more material than simply crafting a new item or combining damaged items. The exception is armor, which consumes less material at the cost of experience levels. Repairing with a matching item works for any item with durability including bows, shears and so on. The items must be a matching tool and of a matching material. For example, a golden pickaxe cannot combine with a golden sword or iron pickaxe. In both cases, the resulting durability is limited to the item's maximum, and there is no discount for \"over-repair\". As a subset of repairing one item with another, the anvil can transfer enchantments from the sacrifice to the target.

In flower forests and meadows, cornflowers only generate as part of gradients. Natural cornflowers are also found in plains villages.

It is the second-highest tier of hoe, having higher mining efficiency, attack speed, and durability than an iron hoe. It can be upgraded into a netherite hoe using a netherite ingot and netherite upgrade at a smithing table. Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability. Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise. Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe. Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled. Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item. Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block. Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.

Shulkers evaluate the collision box of scaffolding based on their current position, which can result in the shulker teleporting to a position right above a scaffolding block, only to find it invalid and teleport again.

Frost Walker–enchanted boots transform any source water block into frosted ice if the player wearing the boots is moving on ground (not falling, jumping, or flying), the water block has air above it, the water block lies within a circle radius or square radius of 2 + level around the player's destination block (i.e., the block onto which the player is about to move), the water block is on the same level as the player's destination block, the player is on the ground, and the player's motion is \"natural\"; i.e., being pushed by a piston head does not count, but being bounced by a slime block that was pushed horizontally by a piston does.

All candles can be used as a light source, emitting light like a sea pickle. A single candle emits a light level of 3. Up to four identically colored candles may be placed in one block, with each candle increasing the emitted light level by 3, for a maximum light level of 12. They also emit fire particles. Candles are not lit when they are placed, and must be lit using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile. If any candle is already lit, more candle(s) that may be added (if possible) are also lit. , a mob/player that is burning, a Fire Aspect book or any sword enchanted with Fire Aspect can also be used to light candles. Any candle may be waterlogged, but waterlogged candles cannot be lit. Lit candles can be extinguished using water (even a water bottle), wind charges, or by the player with the candle. When the Render Dragon Features for Creators experiment is enabled in Minecraft Preview, the center of all types of lit candles emits colored point lighting with . This causes the bottom part of the candle to render a small shadows below it. A single candle of any color may be on an uneaten cake, turning it into a candle cake, which acts as a normal, singular candle on top of a cake.

However, due to the invulnerability timer, the total damage is capped at the highest individual amount of damage dealt this way, and damage may or may not be caused in individual chunks. As a result, wearing multiple pieces of high-level Thorns armor pieces not only increases the overall chance to deal damage, but also shifts the average amount of damage dealt this way towards the upper end of the possible range. (Since damage and health are both floating point numbers, the chance to literally reduce health by exactly 5.0 are next to zero. The typical maximum number of hearts lost from thorns damage is 2, but can rarely be 2½ due to rounding.) Average damage dealt depending on the number of items with Thorns III worn are as follows: Thorns applies a durability penalty to the armor. It reduces durability by an additional 2 points when inflicting damage. If multiple armor pieces are enchanted with Thorns, the durability penalty is applied to each piece that triggered (even if it didn't end up inflicting the highest damage), regardless of what level of Thorns that piece has. If the item is also enchanted with Unbreaking, the usual probabilities for ignoring each individual point of durability loss apply. Thorns damage can be blocked by a shield, if there is an opportunity to block, usually because the damage triggering the thorns effect comes from a projectile. The Thorns effect can trigger from any equipment slot, including e.g. the body slot of horses or holding the enchanted item in the main or off-hand.

Unbreaking can be obtained from enchanting tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid, books obtained by fishing, monster room chests, librarian villagers, and non-village structure loot. For tools and weapons, there is a 100%÷(level+1) chance that using the item reduces durability, which means that the item has a 50%/66.66……%/75% chance of not using any durability. On average, tools last 2/3/4 times as long. For armors, there is a 60%+40%÷(level+1) chance a use reduces durability, meaning each durability hit against Unbreaking armor has a 20%/26.66……%/30% chance of being ignored. On average, armor lasts 1.25/1.3636……/1.428571428571…… times as long. Technically, only level below 0 of Unbreaking can lower the reduce-durability chance less than 60%. When durability is reduced by multiple points, for example, when hooking a mob with fishing rods or getting blown up with TNT, Unbreaking is applied for each point of decision of actual reduction.",

Name tags are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt. See fishing for more details. To use a name tag, it must first be renamed with an anvil, costing 1 experience level. A stack of up to 64 name tags can be renamed at once, and the cost is still 1 experience level per stack. If it is not renamed, it has no effect when used on a mob. After the name tag is renamed, the player can it on a mob to give it the name given to the name tag from the anvil. Mobs and name tags can be renamed any number of times. Name tags with the same name are stackable. Once a mob is named, it keeps its name, and the name tag is consumed. When a mob is named, it is excluded from the mob cap count. Effects on various mobs: A named silverfish that goes into a block appears to lose its name because it is replaced by a newly generated unnamed silverfish when the block is broken. A creaking spawned by a creaking heart can survive during the day if named. A baby (animal or villager) keeps its name when becoming an adult. A named villager keeps its name when transformed into a zombie villager. Once transformed, the zombie villager can despawn naturally unless it was transformed by a named zombie. A named zombie villager keeps its name when cured. Wandering traders still despawn even if they are named, or in a minecart or boat. A named wither's boss bar displays its name instead of \"Wither\". Naming an ender dragon with commands also displays the name in the boss bar. Any mob can be named except for the ender dragon and the agents. Players also cannot be named. A name tag can rename an armor stand, though it does not show the nameplate above its head until CustomNameVisible:1b is set as an extra step. a name tag on a villager or wandering trader renames the mob instead of opening the trading interface.

The following color palettes are shown on the designs on trimmed armor: (a darker color palette is used when a netherite armor piece is trimmed using a netherite ingot). Netherite ingots are the repair items for the netherite tier and armor material, and thus can be used to repair the following items in an anvil: A netherite ingot could be used to select powers from a beacon instead of using an emerald, gold ingot, iron ingot, or a diamond.

And if the non-stackable item is pushed, the output power level increases to 4. The hopper is held deactivated by the powered dust when the circuit is off, and by the powered dropper when the circuit is on. But, when the input turns off, there is a brief 1-tick moment when the dropper has just turned off, but the torch attached to it hasn't turned on again. This allows the hopper to activate for 1 tick, pushing an item back into the dropper. A hopper always pushes items from its left slots first, so the hopper pushes back the item the dropper pushed into it, rather than any of the 16-stackable items in its far right slot, allowing the circuit to reset itself. Variations: The player can remove one of the items from the dropper to create a 2-RNG with different power level outputs than the regular 2-RNG: removing the 64-stackable item outputs power levels 2 or 4, removing the 16-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 4, and removing the non-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 2. You can add additional redstone dust leading from the hopper to a block next to it, and then down to the side of the comparator. This 2-wide variation keeps the comparator's output off while the input is off. With only three items in the dropper, all three output power levels are chosen with equal probability. The probability of the output levels can be changed by adding additional 64-stackable, 16-stackable, and non-stackable items to the dropper (which must all be different from each other so they don't stack). For example, with one 64-stackable item, one 16-stackable item, and two different non-stackable items, the RNG outputs power level 1 25% of the time, power level 2 25%",
