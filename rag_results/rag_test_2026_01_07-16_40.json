Honey bottles remove Poison when drunk and can be used to craft honey blocks and sugar. A honey bottle can be obtained by a glass bottle on either a beehive or bee nest with a honey level of 5. Doing this angers any bees inside, causing them to attack the player, unless there is a campfire or another block on fire within 5 blocks below the nest or hive. Using normal fire would likely cause the nest, bees, and flowers around it to burn. A dispenser with glass bottles can be used to collect the honey without angering the bees. The honey bottle appears as an item in the dispenser's inventory. If the dispenser is full, the honey bottle is shot out. To drink a honey bottle, press and hold while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking one restores hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation and returns a glass bottle. Consuming the item also has the benefit of removing any Poison effect applied to the player. Unlike drinking milk, other applied effects are not removed upon drinking a honey bottle. Honey bottles can be drunk even with a full hunger bar. Drinking a honey bottle takes 25% longer than eating other food - 2 seconds - and has a unique sound.",

Unlike wind charges, Wind Burst does not negate fall damage. Wind Burst can only be obtained from ominous vaults in trial chambers in the form of enchanted books at level I. It is a rare enchantment, having a 5.5% chance of being ejected from an ominous vault. When executing a smash attack using a mace enchanted with Wind Burst, the user is launched back into the air, allowing them to chain continuous smash attacks. Attacks on the ground do not activate Wind Burst, as the activation requires a smash attack. In order to perform a smash attack, and in turn activate Wind Burst, a player has to fall more than 1.5 blocks. This can be achieved by jumping off a single block placed on the ground and attacking right before touching the ground (total fall height of ~2 blocks), or alternatively by using a wind charge or the Jump Boost effect. Due to the slow attack speed of the mace in Java Edition, it is impossible to chain fully-charged smash attacks with Wind Burst I on a target that stays at the same elevation. Like wind charges, Wind Burst can interact with redstone objects such as levers or wooden doors. Since foxes can attack mobs by pouncing on them, a fox given a mace enchanted with Wind Burst is capable of activating it. This is of little benefit to the fox, as it will typically fail to chain a second smash attack and will thus take fall damage. Wind Burst adds approximately 8 blocks of upward knockback for the first level, 16 blocks for the second level, and 24 blocks for the third level. Blast Protection reduces the effect of Wind Burst. The table below details the explosion knockback multiplier and blocks launched per level. Further Wind Burst levels use the formula 1.15 + 0.35 * level to calculate the knockback multiplier.
