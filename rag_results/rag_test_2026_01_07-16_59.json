Since the world is made up of one layer of air, only the platform generates. Below the platform, there is just void, and above the platform, there is just sky. If the Void is chosen for a single biome world, terrain generates the same as if using Default world option, but without any structures or features. The void start platform does generate on the same coordinates as in the superflat world, which puts it inside of the bedrock layers at the bottom of the world. Such a world consists almost entirely out of just nine blocks: Only terrain features can generate in this world. They include caves and ore veins. Thanks to ore veins, an additional six blocks generate naturally: Occasionally, water and lava can form obsidian and cobblestone (and there is one additional cobblestone in the center of the start platform). These seventeen blocks in total represent 100% of the natural terrain in this world. This biome can be useful for constructing a redstone contraptions world without interference from the surroundings. It can also be useful for building completely custom terrain from scratch. Because void doesn't generate in a default world, visiting it is not required for any advancement. No mobs apart from phantoms and pillager patrols can spawn naturally.

      "chunk_text": "Copper golems cannot see the contents of chests (either wooden or copper) without manually opening and examining them, and do not remember correct item matches. When a copper golem deposits items in a chest, it attempts to add them to the frontmost available slot. If the deposited item is stackable, it avoids adding to existing stacks in any slot other than the frontmost available one. If the chest or copper chest a copper golem is walking toward can no longer be opened (e.g. it has a cat sitting on it) or is destroyed, the copper golem marks the position as visited and moves on. Copper golems do not simultaneously open a chest that another non-player entity is already interacting with, such as another copper golem. Copper golems search for chests and copper chests in a 65×17×65 cubic area centered on the copper golem's block position. Copper golems interact only with wooden chests, trapped chests and copper chests. They ignore items dropped on the ground, ender chests, minecarts with chests, boats with chests, and all other containers. Once fully oxidized, a copper golem has a 0.58% chance per tick to become a copper golem statue and take a random pose, provided it is not waxed and is fully located in air (that is, a copper golem cannot turn into a statue while underwater or standing on a partial block such as a slab, as part of its hitbox is not located within an air block). This process takes on average 8.62 seconds. During the transformation, any items held by the copper golem are dropped. If the golem was named using a name tag, it keeps its custom name. an axe on a copper golem statue removes the oxidization one stage at a time. If the statue is unoxidized, scraping it with an axe reanimates it into an unoxidized copper golem. Iron golems occasionally hold out a poppy, which a copper golem can take and place on top of the rod on its head. Using shears on the copper golem drops the poppy. Alternatively, it drops when the copper golem turns into a copper golem s",
