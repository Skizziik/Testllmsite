      "chunk_text": "Stairs are blocks that allow mobs and players to change elevation without jumping. There are 58 variants of stairs: All stairs have the same crafting recipe format, where six blocks result in four stairs of the same type. All stairs except wooden stairs and bamboo mosaic stairs can be obtained by stonecutting. This is more efficient than crafting them, since each block directly results in one stair of the same type. To place stairs, a stairs item while pointing at a surface facing the space the stairs should occupy. When placed, a stair orients itself with the half-block side closest to the player. Stairs can be placed either right side up or upside-down: Pointing at a block top or the bottom half of a block side places the stairs right side up. Pointing at a block bottom or the top half of a block side places the stairs upside-down. Stairs change their shape to join with adjacent stairs (of any material): When a stairs' half-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs' full-block side wraps into an \"L\" shape to join the other stairs (it creates an \"inner corner\"). When a stairs' full-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs' full-block side shortens to join the other stairs' full-block side (it creates an \"outer corner\"). Right side up stairs do not join with upside-down stairs and vice versa. Walking up stairs is faster than jumping up the same distance. Walking up a stairway doesn't cost any exhaustion from the player's hunger bar, compared to 0.2 exhaustion per jump. Therefore, walking up stairs doesn't make the player hungry at all. Generally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, transparent blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces. The full-block faces of stairs do block light, and their non-full faces let light through the gaps.",

This video by mooing_cowmilk provides an overview of most CUD designs, and also includes an explanation of them. This method uses the mechanics of a chest. When a chest is locked, the comparator doesn't realize that it shouldn't be turned on anymore. When the player updates the comparator, it realizes and resets the system. It's also possible to block the chest with an ocelot or cat. When an ocelot sits on a chest, the player can't open it. The player can move it using pistons, minecarts, or water. Using minecarts, players can make a silent CUD (besides the meow sound). This method uses a filled cauldron that is being pushed by a piston. The comparator doesn't notice that the cauldron has been pushed down and stays powered until it gets an update. Note that the cauldron should contain water. This method is often used in BUDs. The player can turn any repeater-based BUD into a CUD by replacing the repeater with a comparator. They can redirect redstone with a detector rail, redstone block, or a solid block, blocking 2 redstone diagonal to each other. Again, the comparator doesn't realize that the redstone isn't pointing the right direction anymore, and it will stay turned on until it receives an update. Comparators can take a redstone output from an item frame, but only if the item frame's position isn't occupied by a block. Many blocks will break the item frame if they are in the same position, but some blocks don't. Examples are water, fence gates, skulls, and flowers. Other devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the CUD switch. CUDs can be made stackable and even tile-able. They can be turned into a toggle-CUD.

And if the non-stackable item is pushed, the output power level increases to 4. The hopper is held deactivated by the powered dust when the circuit is off, and by the powered dropper when the circuit is on. But, when the input turns off, there is a brief 1-tick moment when the dropper has just turned off, but the torch attached to it hasn't turned on again. This allows the hopper to activate for 1 tick, pushing an item back into the dropper. A hopper always pushes items from its left slots first, so the hopper pushes back the item the dropper pushed into it, rather than any of the 16-stackable items in its far right slot, allowing the circuit to reset itself. Variations: The player can remove one of the items from the dropper to create a 2-RNG with different power level outputs than the regular 2-RNG: removing the 64-stackable item outputs power levels 2 or 4, removing the 16-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 4, and removing the non-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 2.

Each time the kelp grows in height by one block, the newly generated top of the kelp plant increases its age by 1. When the top block of the kelp plant reaches an age of 25, it stops growing. This means that kelp can naturally grow to a height between 2 (if the first kelp plant had an age of 24) and 26 blocks (if the first kelp plant had an age of 0). When a kelp plant block is broken, the age of the kelp plant block underneath is randomized to a value from 0 to 24 and the kelp continues growing until it reaches age 25. It is possible to use this mechanic to cultivate a kelp plant to increase its growth height beyond its natural maximum height of 26 blocks. This can be done by breaking the top-most block of the kelp plant each time it reaches age 25. A kelp plant cultivated by a player in this way repeatedly grows until it reaches the water surface.
