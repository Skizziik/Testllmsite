      "chunk_text": ";Daylight detector exploiting You can use daylight detectors to send a Redstone signal downward in 1 tick, but the path needs to be unobstructed by anything. You need to have a piston push a block over the sensor. It detects the change in light and emits a Redstone pulse. This design is extendable upward as far as you want, but you need to have the original hole open to sunlight. It also works only during the day, because it uses shadows to activate. An observer can be used to detect the block update that occurs when a water source changes to a bubble column (or vice versa). When swapping the block below a column of water sources to soul sand or a magma block from some other block, the entire column immediately changes to bubble column blocks. This can be used to quickly transmit a redstone signal upward to an observer facing the top water source/bubble column block. A setup that can carry a pulse signal downward across any distance involves walls of any type, a piston, and an observer. When a wall block has a solid block on two opposing sides and non-solid blocks (e.g., air) on the other two sides, it takes a flat shape. This is vertically repeatable up to any height. However, when a wall/solid block is placed into one of the two air blocks around a flat wall, the flat wall block and every flat wall block below it are updated to a different version of the wall with a column in the middle. This update is instant and can be detected by an observer watching any flat wall in the tower. The update can be made repeatable by having a regular piston face the flat wall at the top of the tower, since the piston head also triggers the wall update. To \"repeat\" a signal means to boost it back up to full strength. The easiest way to do this is with a redstone repeater. Variations include: Repeats a solid signal without the delay introduced by a redstone repeater. Repeats a signal in both directions. A comparator has two modes: comparing and subtracting.

A multiplex circuit transmits multiple signals on a single transmission line by using a control line to choose which signal should be transmitted or received. The control line may be either clocked, to transmit the signals sequentially, or selection, to simply choose which signal to transmit. The control line(s) can also be substituted with two synchronized pulse generating clocks. Then only one line is necessary. However, they have to stay synchronized for the transmission to be correct.

Only blocks with block states hanging=false or with age=4 drop themselves. Hanging mangrove propagules generate under leaf blocks of mangrove trees that spawn in mangrove swamps. Wandering traders may sell 1 mangrove propagule for 5 emeralds. Applying bone meal to a block of mangrove leaves with a space underneath produces a hanging mangrove propagule with age=0. Bone meal can then be applied to the propagule itself to increase its age by 1. A hanging mangrove propagule cannot grow into a tree. Like saplings, non-hanging mangrove propagules have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees. When a tree is to be grown, a height is chosen and then the ground and space are checked; if the ground is bad or there is not space for the chosen height, the tree does not grow. Bone meal can be used to speed up the growth of the propagule, even to grow the tree without sufficient light. Also like saplings, mangrove propagules can grow only if a player is within a certain radius, even in loaded chunks. Mangrove propagules can be placed on all variants of dirt (except dirt paths), moss blocks, mud, and clay. It requires a light level of at least 9 to grow.

Bees leave their nest during the day. They fly around their nests and are attracted to flowers (except closed eyeblossoms), flowering azaleas, flowering azalea leaves, mangrove propagules, pink petals, cherry leaves, spore blossoms, chorus flowers and wildflowers. Bees can pollinate wither roses but receive the wither effect. As a result, bees can die. Bees can also pollinate open eyeblossoms, but get poisoned as result; they cannot pollinate and completely ignore closed eyeblossoms. Bees also completely ignore flowers in flower pots. After circling a flower for more than 400 ticks, a bee collects nectar. However, if the bee gets damaged, it ceases its pollination efforts. A bee carrying nectar has nectar spots on its abdomen and drops nectar particles to fertilize plants below the bee. Bees that have nectar may pollinate wheat crops, potato crops, carrot crops, beetroot crops, melon stems, sweet berry bushes, pumpkin stems, cave vines, torchflower crops, and pitcher crops that they fly over. When one of these plants gets pollinated, it advances to another growth stage, similar to using bone meal. To pollinate a plant, a bee must be 1 to 2 blocks directly above the plant and must have a valid home hive. A bee can fertilize plants 10 times each time they have nectar. There is an approximately 5% chance each tick to attempt fertilization. Afterward, the bee flies back into its hive/nest to make honey. It takes about 2 minutes for the bee to do this. Bees live together in colonies and take any bee nest or beehive that has enough space as its home. One bee nest/beehive can house up to 3 bees.

Terrain underwater in lakes is coated with a layer of orange terracotta, with shallow areas occasionally featuring white terracotta too. Deeper bodies of water may contain scattered gravel. Rainfall never occurs in eroded badlands, as the biome is arid, and lightning never strikes here. Exception to both rules are rivers that cut through eroded badlands, which still experience both. Eroded badlands feature unique formations of terracotta hoodoos, narrow spires that rise up from the red sand floor of the biome's drainage basins.

Using slime blocks together with a basic piston tower may drastically improve its performance, because less pistons are used for the same height in comparison to a simple piston tower, and piston moves more blocks. Up to 11 slime blocks per piston can be used. If using more than two slime blocks per piston, the piston tower can transmit a signal upward. A simple piston tower can't transmit signals up because effects of quasi-connectivity cause the tower to freeze in its state and not disable upon falling edge.
