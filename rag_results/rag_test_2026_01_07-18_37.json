The schematic of a simple two-way telegraph is shown on the right. 1 and 2 are small control rooms, and A and B are inverters. Note that the area in between the two inverters can be elongated, with appropriately spaced redstone repeaters. The classic telegraph allows for a speedy construction and a space as small as 1×2×2 for each control room. In addition, due to its limited size and capability, it requires little to no knowledge of logic gates or circuitry, making it ideal for beginners or when you're low on redstone. The downside is that while you may be new to Minecraft, you have to be remarkably fluent in whatever language you decide to send the telegram in. This goes for the receiving party as well. In fact, they must begin reading the message the instant you begin sending it, or risk losing its meaning entirely. This quickly becomes problematic, especially when the server is lagging. Despite this, players use it anyway, often because they enjoy the great similarity it holds to real telegraphs. So while the classic telegraph is compact, simple, and highly realistic, it may be worthwhile to look into a more advanced system. Although the classification spans most telegraph types, the multi-directional telegraph is quite unique in its general design, and can be challenging to configure. This is mainly due to the amount of wiring required, and, in turn, the amount of space needed. For instance, a three direction telegraph requires a minimum of six separate lengths of wire, and that's just to create a classic one-torch receiver system, with no additional capabilities. While this is less of a problem over short distances, acquiring the massive quantities of redstone needed for such a project can be problematic, and it is good practice to make a rough estimate of how much you'll need before beginning its construction. This is a really simple Morse code receiver and sen",

A third way to obtain renewable dirt is by buying podzol or rooted dirt from wandering traders. However, only 18 blocks of podzol or 10 blocks of rooted dirt can be purchased from each trader, so this method cannot be performed on a large scale.

For comparison, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about 40,075,000 meters. Both areas of the Far Lands feature extremely strange terrain, although they are significantly different. In both zones, any area beneath sea level, excluding regular caves, are flooded with water. The Far Lands generate biomes, but most biomes are indistinguishable except by the color of grass. Desert biomes are covered in sand and snow-covered biomes are covered with snow, excluding the very top of the map due to the height build limit. Trees generate somewhat normally, but can be found only in the upper areas of the map due to the need for skylight. Ores can be found up to their respective maximum heights just like in the normal world. Unfortunately, due to the flooding, everything except for coal can be extremely difficult to acquire. In the solid areas of the Far Lands, normal caves still generate but are limited and small. Along with the caves, dungeons (which are extremely rare) and lakes can be found in solid areas. Water and lava springs can be found out in the open and in caves. Much of the open space in both areas are shrouded in darkness and thus hostile mobs run rampant, making the Far Lands as a whole incredibly dangerous. This is especially problematic in the Corner Far Lands due to its layered structure. The flooded zones have an abundance of squid. The Far Lands edge boundary (that is, where it meets the regular map) looks like a solid wall, all the way to the top of the map (Y coordinate 127 in beta 1.8 and earlier) which is filled with gaping holes perpendicular to the edge.

Due to this, blocks that require a solid surface for placement can be placed on these faces. Double slabs are handled as a single block instead of two different slabs; as such, breaking one destroys the whole block and drops two slabs, as opposed to breaking only one slab within the same block-space. \"Double slabs\" that are not aligned to the grid (i.e. a bottom slab on top of a top slab) are handled as separate blocks and are broken individually. Redstone dust placed on a top slab receives signals from redstone dust one block lower and adjacent, but cannot transmit signals down to that block. Due to the way blast rays propagate from an explosion, bottom slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them. In some cases, only the slab is destroyed from a TNT explosion directly on top of it. Explosions from end crystals and creepers are also weakened. Sneaking reduces the player's hitbox height to 1.5 blocks, allowing the player to fit through such a gap (for example, walking over a bottom slab with one block of air above it, or in a two block high tunnel with an upper slab on the ceiling). A player cannot walk from a block of soul sand directly up to a bottom slab without jumping – this applies not just to soul sand, but to any block of a block high or shorter, because the maximum step height of the player is 0.6 of a block. The player can walk off a bottom slab while sneaking, because the sneaking prevents falling only when the distance is higher than one half block. If a single slab is placed in a water source block, or water is placed onto a single slab using a water bucket, the empty half of that slab's block is waterlogged. If a slab is placed in flowing water, a pocket of air is created in the unfilled half of the block. If the player's head is in this pocket, the player can breathe and see as clearly ",
