Swamp biomes are usually found in flat terrain near sea level in regions with very high erosion values, and they also replace rivers in these areas.

Players experience extreme frame-rate drops and very high CPU usage, which continue until Minecraft freezes completely. The frame-rate drops do not occur in multiplayer servers, though the server itself lags depending on the server computer's RAM. In both single-player and multiplayer, the intense lag that is characteristic of the Far Lands is caused by massive numbers of falling sand or gravel entities. Lightning bolts that hit surfaces at the top of the map (Y-coordinate 127) are invisible and do not cause a fire. The particles created when rain hits these surfaces are black instead of blue.

They can generate in all three dimensions, and are intentional. In the Overworld, the floors of erosions are always replaced with stone. They expose ores such as coal ore, copper ore and iron ore. In badlands erosions, gold ore can also be seen. Erosions in The Nether replace the floor with netherrack. Nether erosions can expose ore such as nether gold ore and nether quartz ore. Because erosions generate independent of the y-axis, if an erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang. Since erosions generate before features, chorus plants can take root in End erosions. The floor of End erosions is always end stone. When the game generates new chunks, the surface depth is calculated for every column inside the chunk based on the minecraft:surface noise. This value is an integer, and when it is less than or equal to 0, the top block from the surface is replaced with air. Note that because surface depth is calculated per-column, every surface in the column is removed; that is, an identical erosion appears above or below another one if there is an overhang. The surface depth rarely reaches these values, eliciting the rarity of erosions. After the hole is generated, the floor is replaced with a stone block of the respective dimension, and the hole is flooded with water if it is at or below sea level. Erosion generation occurs before carver creation in the terrain generation process, meaning that caves, features, and structures can disrupt or even completely conceal them.

Flying machines are much more restricted due to the lack of quasi-connectivity and other piston behaviors. , a sticky piston powered with a 1 tick pulse drops the block it is carrying. The absence of these behaviors makes it difficult to create complex flying machines. These are basic flying machine designs. The shown examples move to the viewer's left. Removing the block of redstone, or placing obsidian in front of the observer, causes the machine to stop. This may be hard to do, unless in creative mode. For players who want to ride their flying machine, it may be hard to add and remove the obsidian or redstone block (especially in survival mode). A slightly easier way is to add layers of another material (such as wood plank) to the machine, stopping just before the limit of what a piston can move and doubling as a practical gondola for the player at the same time. From a position sitting on the machine somewhere, the player may add another wood plank block to the machine, killing the speed. Removing the final block causes the machine to start again. Simple engine 2The simple engine 2 provides a narrower but longer design, which requires less redstone than others (less redstone blocks). In this example, the machine would begin moving to the left once the observer on the right is activated. This can be done with a redstone pulse, or just lighting the face with flint and steel. To reverse the direction of this machine, simply move one of the slime blocks to the back, and switch the piston and sticky piston.

The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally composes part of the exit portal at the center of the central island. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the void without exploiting glitches. An unlimited number of End gateways generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock and an End gateway block. If the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the ender dragon is defeated or re-summoned. An End gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each ender dragon, which is mostly made of bedrock.",

The strength of the input signal in these circuits usually doesn't matter. When an input or output supplies a redstone signal, it is usually just referred to as \"on\", and when there is no signal, it is referred to as \"off\". For example, an AND gate takes two redstone signals as input, and outputs a redstone signal only if both inputs are greater than 0. That is, an AND gate is on only when both inputs are on. In electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in Minecraft, all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results. A NOT gate (aka \"inverter\") is on if its input is off. The simplest NOT gate is an input signal with a redstone torch attached. An OR gate is on if any of its inputs are on. The simplest OR gate is to feed multiple input signals together into a single block or redstone wire. A NOR gate is on only if none of its inputs are on. The simplest NOR gate is to feed multiple input signals into a block with a redstone torch attached. An AND gate is on only if all of its inputs are on. The simplest AND gate is to add redstone torches in front of each input to a NOR gate. A NAND gate is on if any of its inputs are off. The simplest NAND gate is to remove the final redstone torch from an AND gate. An XOR gate is on if its inputs are different. An XNOR gate is on if its inputs are equal. An IMPLY gate is on unless the first input is on and the second input is off.

Water traps use water to suffocate, trap, or push the target. None of these traps will work on zombies, as they will turn into drowned after drowning, instead of dying. Players who use potions of Water Breathing will also be unaffected. Make a water elevator using soul sand bubble column, but without an exit at the top. The column will force the unfortunate player upward, where they will be trapped against the ceiling, taking a very long time to break their way out because of the fact that blocks break much slower while not on the ground and while underwater. Cobblestone can be swapped for stronger blocks like obsidian. This can also be used reversely, with magma blocks, taking advantage of the fact players cannot swim upward easily. In both cases, the players may not drown since they're in a bubble column, or you could make it more dangerous and put a sign or button with lava on the top but make sure to not have the lava touch water or flammable blocks. Create a water current that drags the mobs down under a solid block. The current will hold the mobs under until they drown. The loot from the mobs will float, making the collection hard. If you us",

Because of the difference in rising and falling edge behavior, off-pulses are extended by 1.5 ticks per piston and on-pulses are shortened by 1.5 ticks per piston and may possibly be erased altogether. This makes piston towers less useful for rapidly changing states. An upward-directed transmission using pistons is not possible due to effects of quasi-connectivity, unless slime blocks are used to move the blocks of redstone. ;Piston-slime block tower circuit delay: 1.5 ticks per piston (rising edge) and none (falling edge) This is a variation of the simple piston tower that uses slime blocks. Using slime blocks together with a basic piston tower may drastically improve its performance, because less pistons are used for the same height in comparison to a simple piston tower, and piston moves more blocks. Up to 11 slime blocks per piston can be used. If using more than two slime blocks per piston, the piston tower can transmit a signal upward. A simple piston tower can't transmit signals up because effects of quasi-connectivity cause the tower to freeze in its state and not disable upon falling edge. If using only one slime block per piston, an upward piston tower turns into a block update detector. ;Combined upward ladder circuit delay: 2 tick per 17 vertical block A vertical transmission circuit can be made by combining both torch tower and redstone ladder, resulting in a ladder with maximum height and minimum delay, as seen in the schematic. Additionally, the first torch can be moved to the middle replacing the top slab and the torch with redstone wire, and adding another top slab before the second torch, which adds one block of height (as seen in the picture). Observers can also be used to create a vertical ladder. Each observer carries block updates to the next observer up",

When first introduced in Beta 1.4, locked chests were indestructible except to explosions, which allowed it to drop. From Beta 1.4_01 up until its removal, locked chests could be broken instantly with any tool or by hand. In Beta 1.4, if the date is April 1st of any year, the game picks a random location to generate a locked chest in every new chunk. If the chosen location is air and has a solid block below, a locked chest generates. The server console outputs \"added a chest!!\" every time a locked chest generates. The locked chest's initial purpose was to direct players to the Minecraft store at the URL . Clicking the would result in the dialog box to the left being displayed. This functionality was exclusive to Beta 1.4; all later versions did not trigger this, and instead the block would disappear after a while, similar to leaves. Locked chests would decide their facing direction according to the blocks around them, generally making an attempt to face outward from walls. If their face was obstructed by a block, they would rotate accordingly to face away from said block. Prior to Beta 1.8, said behavior was standard for directional blocks such as chests and furnaces. From Beta 1.8 onward, said blocks would instead face toward the player placing them, and would not change their facing direction depending on nearby blocks. The locked chest, being an unsupported block, was not subject to this change, and retained its old behavior up until its removal, making it unique in this aspect. Locked chests could be used as fuel, lasting 1.5 items, the same as a regular chest. Locked chests can be placed under note blocks to produce the \"bass\" sound.",

For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met: # The dirt block receiving grass must be within a 3×5×3 range of the source grass block where the source block is in the center of the second topmost layer of that range. # The source grass block must have a light level of 9 or brighter directly above it. # The block directly above the dirt block must allow light to pass through it and hit the dirt block, even though the actual light level does not matter. That means blocks that partially let light through such as stairs and slabs must not have their light-blocking side(s) facing the dirt block. # The block directly above the dirt block must not be lava, water, or a waterlogged variant of a block.

Placing a block behind each of the input repeaters and moving the input/output lines closer to the repeaters' outputs means that signal strength is lost only in side movement at input, allowing an additional dust between the circuits (and thus a more efficient transmission), but requires that the transmission lines alternate which side they run on.
