This video by mooing_cowmilk provides an overview of most CUD designs, and also includes an explanation of them. This method uses the mechanics of a chest. When a chest is locked, the comparator doesn't realize that it shouldn't be turned on anymore. When the player updates the comparator, it realizes and resets the system. It's also possible to block the chest with an ocelot or cat. When an ocelot sits on a chest, the player can't open it. The player can move it using pistons, minecarts, or water. Using minecarts, players can make a silent CUD (besides the meow sound). This method uses a filled cauldron that is being pushed by a piston. The comparator doesn't notice that the cauldron has been pushed down and stays powered until it gets an update. Note that the cauldron should contain water. This method is often used in BUDs. The player can turn any repeater-based BUD into a CUD by replacing the repeater with a comparator. They can redirect redstone with a detector rail, redstone block, or a solid block, blocking 2 redstone diagonal to each other. Again, the comparator doesn't realize that the redstone isn't pointing the right direction anymore, and it will stay turned on until it receives an update. Comparators can take a redstone output from an item frame, but only if the item frame's position isn't occupied by a block. Many blocks will break the item frame if they are in the same position, but some blocks don't. Examples are water, fence gates, skulls, and flowers. Other devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the CUD switch. CUDs can be made stackable and even tile-able. They can be turned into a toggle-CUD. CUDs can be made pistonless using ocelots. A T-CUD toggles between 2 states.",

Every 30 seconds to 5 minutes, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4–16 blocks. They can target players, armor stands, cameras, and any mob except for ghasts and other goats. A charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target. If the charge connects, it deals to damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of knockback to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall. As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way. If a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first. If a goat rams a solid block that occurs naturally in its environment, it can drop one of its goat horns. Mobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for piglins, piglin brutes, hoglins, zoglins, \"Johnny\" vindicators and wardens. Goats don't target players in Creative mode or any players in Peaceful difficulty. Unlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it and do not call for backup if harmed. Baby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks. A screaming goat tries to ram a valid target every 5 to 15 seconds. An adult goat can be milked by a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket. Screaming goats make a distinct sound when this happens.

You probably had that terrible moment where you were building a sink bowl in a mob farm when all the water turned into source blocks. This source trick can be used as an RGM component. Make an almost-complete sink bowl, and then add a dispenser that adds water in the right way to turn the whole bit into a huge source. This allows the water to wash away a sand-supporting torch on the other side. A dispenser can use a fire charge to light log or wool on fire, with sand or a redstone torch above the log or wool. Once the block disappears, the sand falls activating a redstone current. However, be careful when using fire, as players don't want to burn their creation down. This technique is risky, due to the chance the fire may run out before reaching the block; however, \"checkpoints\" (dispensers with fire charges in the middle of the fire track) and netherrack may make such occurrences less likely. Although great on their own, implementing Minecraft (or indeed, any other sandbox game that allows the construction of these machines) into a real-life physical Rube Goldberg machine can add much more depth into both. Using an object heavy enough, such as a big marble, to activate a button that causes an action (for example, the mouse buttons), can achieve said effect. This can be seen in DoodleChaos's 23rd Rube Goldberg , where a block is broken and a creeper dies as a result of this.

If a village has more than one naturally-spawned iron golem and a player attacks one in front of the other(s), all iron golems of that type may become hostile to the player. Iron golems are not provoked by players who attack wandering traders. Although they are guardians of villages, iron golems are not actually provoked when a mob attacks a nearby villager (in contrast to a player attacking a villager), given that the iron golem is not already hostile to the type of mob by default. With the exception of creepers and goats, they are provoked when attacked by any mob, and by the presence of nearby monsters. Even if a witch accidentally throws a positive splash potion at an iron golem during a raid, this does not stop the iron golem from attacking the witch. Iron golems are ineffective against flying hostile mobs that don't venture into the iron golem's reach, such as ghasts and phantoms. The list below contains mobs that can have hostile interactions with iron golems. The iron golem also attacks neutral mobs or hostile mobs that can attack the player, such as piglins or zombified piglins. A naturally-spawned iron golem knows where raiding illager locations are from behind solid walls and from underground and attempts to move toward them. An iron golem created by the player or summoned by a command cannot detect raiders through obstructions. Iron golems also look up or down if the hostile mob is above or below the iron golem. Zombies (and variants), zoglins, skeletons (and variants), spiders, cave spiders, slimes, magma cubes, withers, ravagers and illagers naturally attack iron golems on sight and may cause major damage, especially if the mobs attack in groups. , silverfish and witches also naturally attack iron golems without provocation.
