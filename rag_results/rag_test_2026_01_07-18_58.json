Like all leather armor, it can be dyed and protects the wearer from freezing. Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, and bogged have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include a leather tunic. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the tunic they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped tunic is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19. When worn, a leather tunic provides armor points. As with all pieces of leather armor, wearing a leather tunic protects the player from freezing in powder snow. Two damaged leather tunics can be combined through crafting or using the grindstone. The durability of the used leather tunics are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either tunic. An leather tunic can also be repaired in an anvil by adding leather, with each item restoring 25% the tunics' maximum durability, rounded down. Two tunics can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods using the anvil preserves the tunic's enchantments. A tunic can receive the following enchantments: It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a tunic, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).

Because cake is only blocks wide, it is possible to stand on the edge of a block beneath a cake. This makes it possible to create a functioning staircase using cakes placed on a ramp of 1×1 blocks. It is possible to place cake on top of another cake by placing a cake on the ground, then placing another cake on the side of a block above and to the side of the first cake, similar to placing torches on a chest. Eating the lower cake causes the upper cake to disappear, as does mining out the block of cake it is sitting on. Mobs on top of cakes rotate while attempting to move, a pathfinding oversight shared with fences. If cake is placed in a hole one block deep, players can get across the hole without jumping, although a player standing on the cake must jump to get out of the hole. Cake was added to Minecraft following the ModDB 2010 Indie of the Year Awards. Notch agreed to add cake to Minecraft if it won, which led to a campaign called \"The Quest For Cake\". Minecraft won 3 of the 7 awards, including the \"Indie of the Year\" award. Placing a cake makes the same sound as placing wool. The player can place cake on top of a bed, and while sleeping, the cake shows on the player's screen as if it were on top of their head.

It is only possible to see them with manipulating the Noise Scale, or by using mods that allow for travel to extreme distances. Players experience extreme frame-rate drops and very high CPU usage, which continue until Minecraft freezes completely. The frame-rate drops do not occur in multiplayer servers, though the server itself lags depending on the server computer's RAM. In both single-player and multiplayer, the intense lag that is characteristic of the Far Lands is caused by massive numbers of falling sand or gravel entities. Lightning bolts that hit surfaces at the top of the map (Y-coordinate 127) are invisible and do not cause a fire. The particles created when rain hits these surfaces are black instead of blue. Snow does not accumulate on these surfaces either (because there is no space) unless a top layer tunnel peeks out. When travelling away from spawn, every time the distance is doubled from the center of the world, there is an issue with precision, where entities and block hitboxes (where the block should be) still match the shape of the world, but what we see (the blocks) don't.

Because they can only generate in the deep dark, they will often be found under mountains and other places with low erosion. An ancient city features a very large palace with a footprint of around 220 blocks on each horizontal axis, stretching throughout a deep dark biome. The floor of the city always generates at the Y level of -51. The palace is made up of long corridors with 2-block-deep layers of gray wool on the floor, and some rugs made of blue, light blue and cyan wool or carpet floors to prevent vibrations, as well as some smaller ruins off to the side of the main corridors, which contain either one or two loot chests.

Many tutorials will want the reader to build an ALU first, and therefore the topic is covered very widely around the internet. The ALU we will be building can perform four important operations on two inputs and return a correct output. A, B, being both 8-bit inputs A >> (bitshift A right (the same as binary divide by 2)) 2 so 5 × = 1010002; five is bumped up by three. So now, one in your new system would be 1 × = 10002 and that would leave room for 0.1, 0.01 or 0.001; 0.01 * = 102. This leads to a more complicated setup for your computer. The subtraction of numbers is surprisingly simple. The ALU first must change the second number (the value subtracting by) and convert it from a positive number to a negative number. A two's complement is when you invert the binary number (so that all the 0s are 1s and 1s are 0s) and add one to it. Example: do 10 subtract 9 This poses the complexity of signed numbers. This is a weight to the binary number to assign it as a positive or negative number. Whether the result is a negative or positive number is determined by the overflow flag. If there is an overflow, this means that the number is positive and otherwise, negative. To implement this, you can ask the ALU to do 3 operations. To do A subtract B, the operations are Multiplication is repeated addition, so the easiest (inefficiently) is to add A to a variable B amount of times. Here's pseudomachine code for it JUMP IF (B > 0) TO LINE 2 However, there are more efficient ways of multiplication. A good method is to repeatedly bitshift the first number to the location of ea",

When decayed or mined with any tool except shears and tools enchanted with Silk Touch, flowering azalea leaves have a 5% chance to drop flowering azaleas. The Fortune enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II and 10% at level III. When bone meal on a moss block, each block in a 3×3 to 7×7 area has a 5% chance of growing a flowering azalea. Flowering azaleas function like any other flowers in their interaction and uses with bees. Flowering azaleas can be placed on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, podzol, moss blocks, farmland, mud, muddy mangrove roots and clay. Unlike most transparent blocks, mobs can spawn on top of flowering azaleas in Java Edition. Putting a flowering azalea in a composter has a 85% chance of increasing the composting level. Flowering azaleas can be used as a fuel source in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per azalea. Unlike saplings, a flowering azalea does not automatically grow into an azalea tree. Therefore, using bone meal on it is the only way to grow an azalea tree. Application of bone meal gives a flowering azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3×5×3 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs. Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with flowering azaleas, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1. Flowering azaleas can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.

There are three variants of the oak tree: small regular oaks, tall and branching fancy oaks, and swamp oaks. Oaks come in several variants with different properties: Small regular oaks are the most common. The leaves are arranged the same as the birch leaf arrangement. Fancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding logs surrounded by leaves. The sapling requires 4&ndash;14 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides. A fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6. Branches and outgrowths, however, require 8 blocks of open space directly above the sapling. An oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a \"brace\" of non-solid blocks (e.g. glass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground. A rare variant is colloquially known as a \"balloon\" oak. This is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible.

The cloud starts with a radius of 3 blocks, decreasing to 0 over the course of 30 seconds.

      "chunk_text": "Aqua Affinity is an enchantment applied to helmets that removes the mining speed reduction that occurs when underwater. Aqua Affinity can be obtained from enchanting tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid, books obtained by fishing, librarian villagers, and in the following structure loot chests: desert pyramids, strongholds, ocean ruins, ancient cities, mansions, pillager outposts, mineshafts, monster rooms, jungle pyramids, and from vaults in trial chambers. Usually when the player's head is underwater, mining blocks takes 5 times as long as mining while out of water. Wearing armor with Aqua Affinity grants 400% submerged mining speed, negating this penalty. The related but distinct speed decrease for mining while floating also results in a 5 times decrease in mining speed. The penalty for floating is not affected by Aqua Affinity. Mining without Aqua Affinity while underwater and floating takes 25 times as long as mining while out of water and standing on the ground. Although unobtainable in Survival mode, levels higher than 1 increase the submerged mining speed by 400% per level, while all levels have the same effect.",
