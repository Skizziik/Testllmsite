They do not attack creepers or ghasts. Standing tamed wolves attack only skeletons and their variants without provocation. Kills by tamed wolves count as player kills: this means mobs killed by a tamed wolf can drop experience, rare drops or equipped items.

They can also be crouching on honey blocks to stick onto them. The mechanics of such machines vary slightly between the Java and Bedrock Editions of Minecraft; This guide covers Java Edition and Bedrock Edition in separate sections. The key blocks for flying machines, more or less in order of appearance: Pistons are capable of pushing (and for sticky pistons pulling) up to 12 blocks. These can simply be arranged in a line in front of the piston, but slime and honey blocks allow carrying along blocks placed to all sides of that line. Various immovable blocks (notably obsidian and tile entities such as furnaces) provide limits and frameworks. Redstone Blocks: The key point here is while most other redstone power sources are partial blocks that get broken by pistons, this one can be pushed or pulled by pistons, so a machine can carry its own power source. Observers are sensors for both the environment and adjacent parts of the same machine, which can also turn a change in one part of the machines into power elsewhere. Slime and Honey blocks are similar: both can \"stick to\" other blocks at their sides, carrying those along with them when pushed or pulled by a piston. Their differences are as follows: They do not stick to each other. Slime blocks are solid blocks, which can take and transmit a redstone signal, while honey blocks are transparent blocks which cannot.

When mining a cluster of more than one turtle egg, the eggs break one at a time, instead of all at once. This is different from other clustered blocks, such as sea pickles or candles. Breaking a cracked turtle egg with a Silk Touch tool resets the growth stage when the egg is placed on a different block.

Smoother mountain peaks can generate at slightly higher erosion values, and at medium erosion values they are replaced with flat, elevated plateaus. When mountainuous areas border oceans, the surrounding land is cut off by large stone cliffs, exposing many caves inside. Mountainuous terrain at high continentalness replaces rivers with middle biomes, often in deep valleys surrounded by tall peaks. Rivers that do generate close to mountains are much deeper and the surrounding terrain is very steep, resembling fjords. Mountain peaks, but also plateaus, often generate in circles of a single peak range, with enclosed valleys with medium biomes inside. When peaks generate without circles at lower erosion values, they cover an area large enough to reach the maximum generation of Y=256, where they are cut off and form plateaus.

When a chest is locked, the comparator doesn't realize that it shouldn't be turned on anymore. When the player updates the comparator, it realizes and resets the system. It's also possible to block the chest with an ocelot or cat. When an ocelot sits on a chest, the player can't open it. The player can move it using pistons, minecarts, or water. Using minecarts, players can make a silent CUD (besides the meow sound). This method uses a filled cauldron that is being pushed by a piston. The comparator doesn't notice that the cauldron has been pushed down and stays powered until it gets an update. Note that the cauldron should contain water. This method is often used in BUDs. The player can turn any repeater-based BUD into a CUD by replacing the repeater with a comparator. They can redirect redstone with a detector rail, redstone block, or a solid block, blocking 2 redstone diagonal to each other. Again, the comparator doesn't realize that the redstone isn't pointing the right direction anymore, and it will stay turned on until it receives an update. Comparators can take a redstone output from an item frame, but only if the item frame's position isn't occupied by a block. Many blocks will break the item frame if they are in the same position, but some blocks don't. Examples are water, fence gates, skulls, and flowers. Other devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the CUD switch. CUDs can be made stackable and even tile-able. They can be turned into a toggle-CUD.

There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the boots they're wearing upon death. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19. When worn, copper boots provide armor points. Two damaged pairs of copper boots can be combined through crafting or using the grindstone. The durability of the used copper boots are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either boots. Copper boots can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the boots' maximum durability, rounded down.

A one-hot encoding consists of multiple digital lines run in parallel, where a value is represented by which line is on (for example, the number 5 might be represented by having only the fifth line on, and all other lines off). A common alternative to one-hot encoding is one-cold encoding, where a number is represented by which line is off instead of which line is on. While a strict one-hot encoding would always have precisely one line hot, a useful alternative is to eliminate the \"0\" line and represent the number 0 with no lines hot. One-hot and one-cold encoding are rarely used for transmitting values over distance, but may be used for inputs (e.g., which button is pressed) or outputs (e.g., which dispenser is activated), with conversion to or from a more efficient transmission encoding in between. They are also used as a transitional encoding — for example, it is relatively complicated to decode from analog to binary directly, but relatively simple to first decode from analog to one-cold, then encode from one-cold to binary. A unary encoding consists of multiple digital lines run in parallel, where a value is represented by the number of lines on (for example, the number 5 might be represented by having 5 of 16 lines powered). A unary encoding might use a convention that lines must be powered starting from one side (allowing values to be determined from the transition from powered lines to unpowered lines) or that they can be powered in any combination (requiring logic circuits or calculations to determine the represented value). Unary encoding is rarely used for transmitting values over distance, but may be used for inputs (e.g., the number of players standing on pressure plates) or outputs (e.g., the number of doors opened along a passageway).

Placing a block behind each of the input repeaters and moving the input/output lines closer to the repeaters' outputs means that signal strength is lost only in side movement at input, allowing an additional dust between the circuits (and thus a more efficient transmission), but requires that the transmission lines alternate which side they run on.

Much of the open space in both areas are shrouded in darkness and thus hostile mobs run rampant, making the Far Lands as a whole incredibly dangerous. This is especially problematic in the Corner Far Lands due to its layered structure. The flooded zones have an abundance of squid. The Far Lands edge boundary (that is, where it meets the regular map) looks like a solid wall, all the way to the top of the map (Y coordinate 127 in beta 1.8 and earlier) which is filled with gaping holes perpendicular to the edge.

Village paths generate at the level of existing terrain, potentially going up steep hills or down ravines without regard for whether an entity could actually traverse the path. Paths do not go below sea level and replace only grass blocks (with air above), water, lava, sand, sandstone, and red sandstone; all other blocks are ignored and the blocks underneath are considered for replacement instead. Villagers use these paths to travel across the village. In plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy villages, paths are comprised of dirt paths and grass. Savanna villages also generate farmland and crops in some areas. Dirt paths that generate over water are replaced by the village style's plank type. Desert villages are generated with smooth sandstone paths. In Single Biome worlds with cave generation, paths may generate on a separate layer from the rest of the buildings. In floating island generation, paths may not generate at all. Trees, lamp posts, and other decorative structures can generate in the middle of paths as obstructions. A subchunk is a \"village center\" if it contains at least one claimed bed, bell, or job site block. The 26 subchunks in a 3×3×3 cube around such a subchunk are also considered part of a village. Villages as a whole have no defined \"center\", \"size\", or \"radius\"; they are defined only based on proximity to any \"village center\" subchunk. A village always consists of at least one acceptable bed and one villager. Rarely, a village structure can generate without beds, thus not qualifying as a village.

It is also a job site block for mason villagers. A stonecutter can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Stonecutters can generate inside mason houses in villages. The stonecutter can be used as an alternative to the crafting table to craft most stone-related blocks. All of its recipes require just one ingredient and produce one product (in varying quantities). It allows skipping steps to craft certain blocks; for example, a stone block can be directly turned into chiseled stone bricks, but requires multiple steps with crafting. It can also be used to cut brick related blocks, such as resin bricks. Stonecutting is also more efficient than crafting for certain recipes. Crafting stairs is more efficient with a stonecutter than a crafting table, as 6 full blocks are crafted into 4 stairs, while stonecutter yields 1 stair per full block. The recipe for cut copper is even more efficient: with stonecutting, 1 block of copper turns into 4 blocks of cut copper, allowing the amount of copper blocks to be quadrupled. The GUI contains a block selection menu that is empty. The menu is populated with blocks that can be crafted from that particular material, only if a block is inserted into its input.

By adjusting noise frequency, hollowness (for cheese caves), and thickness (for spaghetti caves, noodle caves, and noise pillars), noise caves can vary in extremely diverse ways.

When the player is on fire outside the fire block, they take damage at per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful difficulty, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this difficulty. Soul fire deals damage at a rate of per half-second, making it more dangerous than normal fire. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the fire (stored in a Fire tag shared by all entities). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by powder snow, rain, water or a cauldron. Mobs that are burning will also be illuminated by the flames in dark areas. Most dropped items that are in fire briefly catch fire and disappear. This includes the item forms of blocks that would not be flammable if placed, including obsidian. The only exceptions are these netherite-related items: netherite tools and weapons, netherite armor, blocks of netherite, netherite scrap, netherite ingots, and ancient debris. If a mob able to drop meat dies while on fire, it drops the cooked version of it, with the exception of fish that is dropped by polar bears. This also applies to the zombie's uncommon potato drop; if a zombie dies while on fire and should drop a potato, it becomes a baked potato. Most Nether mobs are invulnerable to fire and cannot burn.

The block of redstone then arrives at its retracted state and tries to power the output dust again, but it also powers the piston above it and block A arrives to cut the output before the repeater can output the signal from the block of redstone. Variation (2-wide): The two upper levels (including the dust on top of the block the repeater is facing) can be moved one block over and down, and the last block on the lower level and its dust removed, to make a 2-wide version that is shorter in height and length (but larger in volume: 2×4×3, 24 block volume). In this version, to reduce the amount of redstone used, the block of redstone can be replaced with a regular block if redstone torches are placed under both its extended and retracted position. Earliest known publication: January 3, 2013 A two-way repeater (aka \"2WR\", \"bi-directional repeater\") is a circuit that can repeat a signal in either direction. Two-way repeaters have two inputs that also act as outputs. Typically the problem to be solved in design is repeating the signal in either direction without repeating the signal back into the same input, which could create a clock, a RS latch or a permanently-powered repeater loop. Each circuit description below lists a transmission speed, the rate at which multiple circuits can transmit signals when placed at maximum distance from each other. Most circuits have their inputs offset from each other by one or two blocks – moving the wires in-line with each other reduces the transmission speed (because the signal has to move sideways to get to the correct input). Current designs also have a two-way reset time – when input from one side is turned on, and then input from the other side is also turned on, then the first input turned back",

Then, if you set a delay of any number of ticks other than the default 1-tick delay on the repeater, it turns into a T-BUD. This process can also be reversed by setting the repeater back to its default 1-tick setting. (It only works since release of Redstone Blocks, though players could theoretically use a normal block and a redstone torch to mimic its effects.) An extremely compact one-time design that is easily hidden and therefore ideal for traps is as follows: Place a piston, a sticky piston is most useful, parallel to the ground. Place a block one block to any side except the piston head and one block above the piston. On the side of the block facing the piston, place a redstone torch. Then place a lever on any other side of the block and switch it on. The redstone torch will go out but the piston will remain extended. You can then break everything except for the piston, but make sure to break the lever after you break the torch. A block update will then cause the piston to retract, possibly pulling the floor out from under the victim. Remember, though, that after the detector is tripped, it has to be rebuilt to be used again. The design looks something like this: Or, for it being smaller: The player can make a 2×1 (3×1 when extended) BUD by having a 2 sticky pistons (stacked) both facing any direction except up and down, then on both of those sticky pistons add Redstone Blocks. Whenever a block is updated, (destroyed, placed etc.) it will switch the bottom piston outwards. Good for traps, as the BUD may need to be compact. The only con to this is that it has to be reset.

The inputs are at the bottom and right and the outputs are at the top and left Truth table for a three-bit sorting device: Timers can detect the time difference between the first input and the second. The amount of time can be determined by how far the signal travels. For example, if 5 of the locked repeaters are powered, it means the time difference was 0.4-0.5 seconds, ignoring lag. If the time difference is exactly 0.4 seconds, 4 repeaters will be powered. The repeaters that will lock can be set to different delays. For example, if they are set to 4 ticks and the first 3 are active, it means the time difference was 0.8-1.2 seconds. You can even have a mix, which can be handy if you know what the range is likely to be. However, you will need to be careful when reading these timers. If you are measuring higher scales, the second signal might not reach all of the repeaters. You will need repeaters to replenish the signal. If the signals are short times (like if you are using observers), you may not have time to read the data. You can also measure how long a signal lasts. Please note the following when making a duration timer: Because of the delay that the redstone torch adds, the delay of the initial repeater, the one that stays unlocked, must be increased to 2 ticks. The data from the timer will be preserved. Because the repeaters will still be powered when the timer is used again, the circuit must be obstructed between uses in order to unlock the repeaters. To do this mine the redstone torch, wait for all of the repeaters to deactivate, and put the redstone torch back.

Blast furnaces can generate in any armorer house; these can be found in a village. Blast furnaces can also generate in trail ruins. Blast furnaces can be pushed by pistons. Blast furnaces are similar to furnaces, but can smelt only raw metal, ore blocks and tools/armor made of iron, gold, chainmail, or copper. Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to smokers, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron or gold nugget from their respective materials. Once an item and a fuel are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to lit and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace. Fuel is also used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items smelted per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by the output. Like normal furnaces, a hopper can be used to feed items into or collect items from a blast furnace. If a blast furnace has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to armorer and claim the blast furnace as their job site block.

Make an almost-complete sink bowl, and then add a dispenser that adds water in the right way to turn the whole bit into a huge source. This allows the water to wash away a sand-supporting torch on the other side. A dispenser can use a fire charge to light log or wool on fire, with sand or a redstone torch above the log or wool. Once the block disappears, the sand falls activating a redstone current. However, be careful when using fire, as players don't want to burn their creation down. This technique is risky, due to the chance the fire may run out before reaching the block; however, \"checkpoints\" (dispensers with fire charges in the middle of the fire track) and netherrack may make such occurrences less likely. Although great on their own, implementing Minecraft (or indeed, any other sandbox game that allows the construction of these machines) into a real-life physical Rube Goldberg machine can add much more depth into both.

Fence posts should be underneath the path and you should drop the sand or gravel for the floor on the fences. Below the fences, you can have a pit. This works because when a gravity-affected block falls on a fence post, the block stays as an entity. As a result, a player walking between the fence posts will fall through the sand entities, causing them to plummet. Diagonal hallways make it more likely to fall through the sand without landing safely on a fence post. Keep in mind that the sand is going to look half a block higher than a normal block, but this can easily be covered up.

All oceans together are the largest biomes by area, covering anywhere around 28–29% of the surface area of the Overworld when factoring in all of its variants. They are deep bodies of water with the surface at an altitude of Y=63 by default, which is counted as the “sea level” of the world. Oceans are vast expanses of water from sea level to the ocean floor, which is at a depth of roughly Y=45 for normal oceans and Y=30 for deep variants. The seafloor is fairly hilly, featuring multiple peaks and valleys, and is mostly covered by a one-block layer of gravel or sand, though some clay, dirt, gravel, and sand patches may generate near the peaks. Canyons can occasionally generate on the ocean floor, forming underwater trenches. Some seafloor peaks may reach high enough to form islands on the surface of the ocean; these islands are typically small and may have very sparse vegetation with very little grass and few oak trees. The seafloor is often covered with seagrass and kelp, with “forests” of kelp frequently reaching close to or even touching the water's surface. Fish, squid, and dolphins frequently spawn within oceans. Shipwrecks and ocean ruins generate within all oceans, while deep ocean variants can occasionally generate ocean monuments. The regular ocean variant mainly generates adjacent to land, while deep variants generate farther from land. Survival in ocean biomes is impractical because of all the water. A player who camps on an island in the ocean faces a rather difficult situation. This means that whatever resources found on an island might be all the player has if the player is unwilling or unable to venture out. See the island survival article for more information.

The same occurs when a slime block is moved by another adjacent slime block. For example, a 2×2×2 cube of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled as a single unit by a piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube. A slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons or a block that can be broken by piston ignores that block. However, if an adjacent block could be moved, but is prevented to by the presence of an unmovable block, the slime block is prevented from moving as well and the piston does not extend. Slime blocks' stickiness is unilateral, as such they can't be pulled by a non-sticky piston and they are not moved if an adjacent (non-slime) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2×2×3 structure of slime blocks may be pushed by a piston as long as no other movable block is adjacent to it.

Nylium drops itself only when mined with a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch; if mined with a normal pickaxe, it drops netherrack. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Warped nylium generates in the warped forest biome. Warped nylium is dropped when an enderman dies while holding it. There are two ways to post-generate warped nylium: bone meal on netherrack that is placed next to or adjacent to warped nylium transforms the netherrack into nylium of that type. Air must be above the netherrack during this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a dispenser with bone meal directly into that netherrack block. If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread. As netherrack generates in nether portals spawn floating, using bone meal on netherrack turns them into nylium, making them renewable. Similar to grass blocks and mycelium, warped nylium decays (based on random ticks) into netherrack when an opaque block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath water or lava. It decays when covered with snow. Like mycelium and podzol, mushrooms can remain on warped nylium blocks in any light level. Huge mushrooms can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on warped nylium. Warped Fungi can likewise be grown into huge warped fungi using bone meal, although the warped fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal is never consumed. Similar to grass blocks, the player can apply bone meal to warped nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generates vegetation that occurs in its native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly crimson forest vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly warped forest vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occassionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5×5 area, centered on the nylium block ",

The damage and range of fired arrows depends on how long the was held before releasing. Skeletons, strays, bogged and illusioners have an 8.5% chance of dropping a normal or enchanted bow on death when killed by a player or a tamed wolf. The chance of dropping a bow is increased by 1% per level of Looting, allowing up to an 11.5% chance of dropping. The chance of being enchanted depends on the difficulty level, but the random enchantment level (5–22) does not. Bows of skeleton horsemen are always enchanted at a random level from 5 to 23. The exact level depends on regional difficulty, as on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment. Enchanted bows are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt. See fishing for more details. When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random enchantments equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an enchanting table, including treasure enchantments like Mending. Bows can be drawn back by them. The player must have at least one arrow in their inventory or be in Creative mode in order to use a bow. When drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to critical charge causes it to visually bob up and down, and causes the fired arrow to have a trail of critical hit particles. Releasing the button shoots an arrow. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use. Arrows shot by bows are blocked by shields. While the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at sneaking speed, unless they are riding a horse, minecart or boat, or flying with elytra. When an arrow hits another player, the player that fired the arrow will hear a high-pitched \"ding\" sound to indicate the successful shot. Fired arrows are not affected by the Strength or Weakness effects. A few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets d",

This is the reason for the long unchanging tunnels in the Edge Far Lands, and plains in the Corner Far Lands. The Farther Lands are caused by an overflow in selector noise, as opposed to the low and high noise that cause the initial set of Far Lands to generate; while selector noise does repeat more often than low and high noise, only half as many octaves are used, causing them to overflow much further out. At the positive end, the remainder starts out relatively small but usually much larger than 1, and grows by 171.103 per block. At the negative end, the remainder starts at −232. This value is then adjusted by ((6x−15)x+10)x3 for quintic interpolation. Even one block in at the positive end, this is already around 1011. The negative end starts all the way around −1049. For the Corner Far Lands, multiply the values of both edges. When interpolation (really extrapolation) is attempted with values as large as these, it produces similarly large output. That output completely dwarfs all other terms that would normally give the terrain its shape, instead effectively passing only the sign of this one noise function through. It was fixed by taking the remainder of the input divided by 224. Noise repeats every 28 units anyway, so it has no side effects. However, it does prevent the overflow. By removing these instructions, the Far Lands can be returned to current versions of the game. There are several other factors to the cause of the Far Lands, making things slightly more complicated: Noise is sampled only every four blocks and linearly interpolated in between. This is why when 12,550,824 is affected by the bug, it reaches out three more blocks to 12,550,821. Each noise generator picks a random offset in [0, 256) to add to its input.

Players should be careful when surfacing from underground in this biome, as the top layers of gravel can pose a suffocation hazard. In other aspects, however, windswept gravelly hills resemble their regular counterpart: the terrain is still elevated and full of falling hazards, and generates hilly and shattered in some areas, often resulting in floating islands. Above Y=120±8, rainfall converts to snowfall, and snow begins to cover the ground. Water also begins to freeze into ice starting at that height. Windswept gravelly hills share their foliage, grass and water color with windswept hills and windswept forests. Emerald ore generates here. On the biome's surface, coal ore and iron ore is found frequently exposed to broad daylight. Underground, occasional infested stone with silverfish can be encountered. The deep dark cannot generate beneath windswept gravelly hills, despite being a highland biome. Farm animals spawn their cold variants in this biome when possible, and llamas generate in herds around the biome. This variant rarely generates in lower humidity values and colder temperature ranges than regular win",

      "chunk_text": "and liquid water blocks]] Solid blocks consist of any type of block that has a collision box that players, mobs, or other entities cannot simply move through, and have to move on top of it or around it. Solid blocks are significantly different from liquid or gas blocks, through which entities can freely pass. Mobs require a solid top surface to spawn. Some mobs are able to spawn inside of the space occupied by another block, but only if their hitbox does not intersect the collision of any solid block. Players, mobs, and other entities can walk on top of solid blocks. Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles or water drip particles) also collide with solid blocks. If a solid block's collision box is a full cube that is solid on all sides, it is known as a full block. For example, stone, planks, and glass are full blocks, but stairs, fences, and chests are not. For most blocks, it's easy to tell whether they're full blocks or not, but some are not so obvious: Cauldrons and composters are not full blocks because their top face is not fully solid. Scaffolding is not a full block because although its interaction box occupies the full block, its collision box does not. Dirt path and farmland are not full blocks because they are slightly shorter than a full block. Mud and soul sand are not full blocks despite visually appearing to be because their collision boxes are shorter than their models, so entities standing on top \"sink into\" the blocks. Whether or not a block is a full block can influence some game mechanics. For example, endermen will only place blocks on top of full blocks and hoppers will not try to collect item entities if their top face is covered by a full block. Most solid blocks are 1 block in height, but certain blocks have non-standard block heights. A player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height, if the difference is at most 0.6 () of a block. From ground level, this is anything the height of a chain or less. A pla",

A cartography table can be obtained using any tool or by hand, although using an axe is the fastest. Cartography tables can generate naturally inside cartographer houses in villages. They can also generate in the trail ruins structure. Regardless of the player's position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing the same direction (the texture with the globe in the right corner always faces west, while the one with the compass and map faces up). Cartography tables are used for zooming out, cloning, and locking maps (making them unable to be altered). They can also be used for adding pointers to maps, creating empty maps, and renaming maps. Below is a list of brief descriptions of all available functions of the cartography table: For more detailed information of each of these functions, see Map § Usage. Zooming out a map always starts with an existing map, not a blank map. Zooming it out makes the map aligned to the grid that would include the area of the original map. To build a set of maps such as for a map wall, a player cannot create several level 0 (base) maps at one location then zoom them out before going out into the world to fill them in; the player must start with a base map created in each area to be covered by the zoomed out map. See more discussion of map alignment at Map. If a cartography table has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager may become a cartographer and claim it as their job site block. A cartography table can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 1.5 items per block. Cartography tables can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.",

The MASIC computer aims to be a one-size-fits-all computer and does not specialize in one task, so it is fully programmable by reading its own memory (explained in Section 2: instruction sets). The simple I/O is great for multipurpose use and the memory is sufficiently sized. It runs at quite a fast speed (because of its small size). Decoders convert binary figures into decimals. For example, looking at the 8-bit decoder, 00 turns on the first lamp which stands for 0. 01 turns on the second lamp which is 1. 10 turns on the third which is 2. 11 turns on the last one which is 3. This is the design for the address decoder we are going to build. Above is a simple 2-bit state, so it has two inputs (left and right) through the repeaters. The output is the redstone line above which will turn OFF when the state is met. The state is whether the redstone input will turn OFF the redstone line above; if so, the state is the redstone inputs. In the above case, the left must be turned OFF (0) and the right (blue) must be turned ON (1) to yield an OFF on the top redstone line. So it expects a state of OFF ON (aka 01 for binary). They are colored blue for bits which should be ON (1) for it to stop powering the top redstone line. Once every bit stops powering the redstone line, it then turns off. These are basically either one or two NOT gates feeding into a OR gate and then NOT the output. Above is an 8-bit state, it expects 8 inputs in exactly the order 0000 1101.

It is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time. Taming depends on the mule's \"temper\". Mules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the mule. While riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed. Like all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. Like their real-life counterparts, mules in Minecraft cannot produce offspring. The only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey. Feeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; baby mules normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health. The table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat. To feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press on the mule. If the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule. Mules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. Mules have three \"equine stats\" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength.

They are slowed by lava, occasionally sinking into it or passing through lava falls, immobilizing them and making them more vulnerable to ranged attacks for some time. Splash potions affect ghasts if the potion hits on their lower half. Despite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered undead mobs. This means they can drown, are damaged by Instant Damage and healed by Instant Health, are affected by Regeneration and Poison, and are not affected by Smite. Despite this, withers never deliberately target them, making them the only non-undead mob ignored by withers (excluding agents, and mobs with the invulnerable NBT tag). They are also completely ignored by wolves, \"Johnny\" vindicators, goats, snow golems, trusting foxes, and zoglins. However, iron golems and wardens attack ghasts, and ghasts do not retaliate. Despite being flying mobs, ghasts can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them. Ghasts shoot fireballs at players, dealing damage to entities and creating an explosion that sets fire to nearby blocks upon impact. Blocks with blast resistance as low as 3.5 survive a fireball's explosion, the explosion itself does no damage unless it hits the entities directly. Hitting a fireball with another projectile or a melee attack deflects it, dealing damage to any ghast hit directly by it, killing them. All other mobs retaliate to the player instead of the ghast if they are hit by a deflected fireball. Ghasts have en",

This way, if source and destination portals are of the same shape, have the same orientation, and no other portals are interfering with the linking, one can safely assume that entities can travel through them as if the portal frames were physically placed behind each other. If no portals exist in the search region, the game creates a new one by looking for the closest suitable location to place a portal, within 16 blocks horizontally (but any distance vertically) of the incoming entity's destination coordinates. A valid location is 3×4 buildable blocks with air 4 high above all 12 blocks, with the long axis matching the long axis of the source portal. The closest valid position in the 3D distance is always picked. Again note that the incoming entity can be almost any entity except withers and the ender dragon or only be a player . This means that if a portal constructed in the Nether exceeds 18 blocks wide, each end will connect to two separate overworld portals. If the first check for valid locations fails entirely, the check is redone looking for a 1×4 expanse of buildable blocks with air 4 high above each. If that fails, too, a portal is forced at the target coordinates, but with Y constrained to be between 70 and 10 less than the world height (i.e. 118 for the Nether or 310 for the Overworld). When a portal is forced in this way, a 2×3 platform of obsidian with air 3 high above is created at the target location, overwriting whatever might be there.

So each byte in the stack memory has 8 bits for us to work with. and some instructions require an address, say loading memory into a register so that we can perform operations (such as addition) on it. Each instruction will be split into two parts, each 4 bits. The first is the TYPE. the TYPE will specify what the computer must do and the ADDRESS will be where the value we will perform our operations are located. so 4 bits for the TYPE, we can have 2^4 types, so 16 different ones.

Fortune increases the maximum number of melon slices dropped, increasing the average yield to 6.4314 with Fortune III. The actual amount is capped at 9, so Fortune III simply increases the chance of getting 9 slices, which is sufficient to craft the melon again from the slices. Melons are naturally generated in jungle biomes, as a pile (and in some farms) in savanna villages and inside tillage rooms of woodland mansions. An enderman holding a melon drops the block upon death. Melon seeds can be planted, placing a small stem that grows over time. Once the stem reaches maturity, it attempts to generate a melon block in one of the four immediately adjacent blocks; however, this attempt may fail if the chosen adjacent block is not empty or the block beneath is not an appropriate block (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, pale moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots). Melons take 10 to 30 minutes to grow, which is equal to 0.5 to 1.5 times the length of a daylight cycle. Once a stem has produced a melon, that stem does not produce any further melons until the existing melon is harvested. Melon stems connect only to the melons they produce.

The CPU follows a cycle four steps, fetch, decode, execute and (sometimes) stores to perform instructions. The CPU first fetches the instruction from RAM, decodes what it means (the instruction will most likely be a number, and the CPU must find out what number it is), and once it understands what the instruction is, it will perform that action. This sometimes requires the data to be put back into the storage, therefore it will store the data. The cycle is then repeated.

Wheat crops are planted in farmland and used to grow wheat and wheat seeds. Wheat seeds can be obtained from breaking short grass, tall grass, fern or large fern, which have a 12.5% chance to yield 1 seed. If harvested with a tool enchanted with Fortune, the drop rate is increased to 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. Harvesting fully-grown crops yields 1 unit of wheat and between 1 and 4 seeds (about seeds/crop harvested on average) , or between 0 and 3 seeds . The looting is calculated by a binomial distribution: a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of around 57% to yield the 1–4 or 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one. Village farm plots have a chance of being wheat crops. The exact chance depends on the style of the village: Wandering traders may sell wheat seeds for 1 emerald. Nitwit and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds at players under the Hero of the Village effect. Wheat seeds can be placed on farmland by right-clicking, where they grow through eight stages. When left alone, wheat seeds planted on farmland grow to become wheat crops, which can be harvested by the player. Seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant and 9 or greater to grow. they can be planted at any light level but need an internal light level of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted on is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5. Breaking the final stage produces 1 to 4 wheat seeds (or more with Fortune) and 1 wheat. If they are harvested early, they drop 1 seed without any wheat. Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops. Like other seeds, wheat seeds c",

They typically serve as a division between two different biomes, but can also split a single biome in two. They are filled with water up to sea level, though rivers may run dry in certain areas due to unusually high elevation. Saddle valleys in mountains can generate rivers, but often too high so that there's not any water. Rivers can vary a lot in width and depth, in generally flat areas rivers are usually around 10 blocks deep but in mountainous regions rivers can reach over 30 blocks in depth which is comparable to deep oceans. Sometimes rivers can also generate as lakes with small islands. Rivers often make giant loops as well, due to a quirk in the terrain generator. Salmon and squid may spawn here. Along the riverbanks, occasional bushes and firefly bushes can be found, and sugar cane grows adjacent to water. Exposed grass takes on a bluish-green hue, similar to the meadow and birch forest biomes, and oak trees can rarely generate where there is available space.

In Bedrock Edition it pulls an item only every two game ticks (10 items per second), four times as fast as a normal hopper. It also picks up items that are lying on a block directly above the track.

It just subtracts from zero \"borrowing\" from the next column like so: This is the same in binary. Let us, for example use a 4 bit binary number for the example: 1 11 111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 -0011 -0011 -0011 1 - 01 - 101 -1101 We could repeat this forever, but that would be useless. This is about what a 4 bit register does: it truncates after 4 bits worth of data. So after we truncate the number (which I kindly did for you in the example, otherwise the number would have an infinite number of 1's to the left). Thanks to this little perk, we can do whatever we want to the 0's after the four of them, including (which is fantastically useful later) adding a single 1 in front of them. Essentially what this is saying is that −b is just the inversion of b (exchange 1's for 0's and 0's for 1's) plus 1. What we have done is turn the first bit into a \"negative sign\" if it is on, but if you have been reading this you realize it is not that simple. Numbers that have a negative sign like this are commonly referred to as signed integers. Numbers like in a normal adder, where two's compliment is not taken into effect are called unsigned integers. Unsigned integers can go to a higher value, but cannot go below zero where as signed integers can go only half as high, but they can go equally as far below zero. This means that the two numbers have the same range, it is just in a different location like so (this is with an 8 bit number): It should be noted that some strange effects can take place when using the lowest signed value (in this case -128) so this should ",

Leaves that decay, or are destroyed without using Silk Touch or shears, yield saplings 5% () of the time, sticks 2% of the time, and otherwise drop nothing. Jungle leaves drop saplings 2.5% () of the time. Oak and dark oak leaves also have a separate but additional 0.5% () chance of dropping an apple, making it extremely rare but possible for a single leaf to drop a sapling, a stick and an apple at the same time. Rates are increased by the Fortune enchantment. Leaves that are burned do not yield saplings or apples. Oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak and mangrove leaves take on a different shade of green depending on the biome in which they are placed.

A repeating clock made with Observers and Pistons (an Observer looking at a piston). A repeating clock made with two Observers with their faces facing each other. A repeater clock consists of a loop of repeaters (usually either redstone repeaters or redstone torches) with occasional dust or blocks to draw off the appropriate pulses. A hopper clock produces timed pulses by moving items back and forth between 2 hoppers feeding into each other and taking a redstone output with comparators. A piston clock produces a loop of pulses by passing a block back and forth (or around, with many pistons) and drawing off a redstone pulse when the block is in a certain location.

It is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping up to 20 raw copper, or 7.7 raw copper on average with Fortune III. Copper ore can be generated anywhere on the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. Copper ore generate in two batches, the first batch generate anywhere on the overworld biomes except dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 16, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends. The second batch generate only in dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 52, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends. Copper ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Copper ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate copper ore. It can also spawn rare ore veins above Y=0, mixed with granite and the occasional raw copper blocks. In dripstone caves biomes, copper ore veins are larger on average. The primary usage of copper ore is to mine it for raw copper. Copper ore does not weather like its block counterpart, though the ore itself shows some oxidation.",

When the input turns on, the outputs turn on in order (e.g., A then B), but when the input turns off, the outputs turn off in reverse order (e.g., B then A). The timing of the output activation and deactivation can be changed by adjusting the delay on the repeaters. All of these designs can be extended indefinitely. Earliest Known Publication: 5 July 2011 (basic concept), 20 June 2012 (Floor ABBA), and 18 July 2012 (Ceiling ABBA). The block update detector switch, or simply BUD, detects any time an adjacent block receives an update. An update is anything that changes that block's state: block placed, destroyed, door opened, repeater delay changed, cake eaten, grass growing, snow falling, furnace used (or turns off), and so on (chests opened and crafting tables used do not cause updates, sleeping in a bed does). When a block is updated, all adjacent blocks are also eligible for an update, and this can be used to produce a redstone signal or for other purposes. BUDs have been used for all kinds of things, from traps to detecting daylight to locking mechanisms on hidden doors. Current BUD switches take advantage of a quirk where pistons can receive power, but not updates, from blocks adjacent to the space the piston head occupies when extended. That is: blocks adjacent to the extended state and not adjacent to the retracted state provide power to extend the piston, but as they are not adjacent to the retracted state do not cause the piston to update when that power state changes. There are many models of auto resetting BUDs. This is done by having the firing of the BUD switch somehow cause the BUD switch to restore the pre-fired state often when fired it cuts the power to the piston, allowing it to retract. This is done either by extra circuitry or, as in the example below, by the properties of blocks themselves. Version 1.1",

The output power level can be used as is (for example, to subtract 1 or 3 from a comparator in subtraction mode), but more often the output is connected to a line of two redstone dust so that the output is 0 or not 0 (to randomly power a repeater, activate a mechanism component, etc.). Variations: If the dropper is powered indirectly (for example, by quasiconnecitvity or an adjacent powered block), the hopper is not be deactivated and immediately pushes the item back into the dropper.

With only two items in the dropper, both output power levels are chosen with equal probability. The probability of the output levels can be changed by adding additional stackable and non-stackable items to the dropper (which must all be different from each other so they don't stack).

A piston can be broken using any tool with equal efficiency, and always drops itself. It is faster to break them with a pickaxe. The pickaxe is also the preferred tool for breaking the head when extended. Pistons are always placed facing toward the player. When powered, the piston's wooden surface (the \"head\") tries to start extending after a start delay. The extension takes to finish. When it extends, it pushes at most 12 blocks.

If the entities cannot be moved, the block is pushed inside them, suffocating mobs when pushed into their eye height (assuming said block is solid). When a piston loses power, its head retracts. Like the extension, the retraction starts after a start delay and takes to finish. A piston that pushes a slime block bounces any entity that it displaces in the direction the piston is facing.

Note blocks can generate in ancient cities. A note block will produce a sound and spawn a colored musical note particle whenever any of the following conditions are met: It is by a player in Survival mode It receives a redstone signal It is by a player. a note block also changes its pitch.

Note block sounds can be heard from up to 48 blocks away, and can be independently controlled by the Jukebox/Note Blocks slider in the audio settings. Each time a note block plays a sound, a note particle will appear from the top. The color of the particle depends on the pitch of the note block.

Placing it in water will cause it to hydrate over time until it becomes a ghastling. A dried ghast can be instantly mined with any tool or by hand, and it always drops itself when mined. If mined while waterlogged, it reverts to its \"dry\" state regardless of which state it has reached while waterlogged. Dried ghasts naturally generate in soul sand valleys as part of Nether fossils and have a (~33.3%) chance of spawning next to one. Piglins have a (~2.13%) chance to barter a dried ghast when given a gold ingot. When a dried ghast is waterlogged, it initiates a rehydration process: green particles appear, and the ghast gradually develops a smiling expression and becomes brighter in color. These visual changes appear in stages, becoming noticeable after about 5 minutes (partially hydrated), more pronounced after about 10 minutes (mostly hydrated), and visually complete (hydrated) after about 15 minutes. After about 20 minutes, it transforms into a ghastling, which matures over time into a happy ghast. If the water is removed during the process, the ghast slowly reverts to the original, dried state at the same rate as it hydrates. Breaking a dried ghast instantly reverts it to the dried state. The exact timings are somewhat randomized: To reach the next stage of hydration or dehydration, a 250 second delay (5000 ticks) must run out, but that delay does not start automatically. Instead, it begins when the dried ghast receives a random tick, i.e. on average after about 68 seconds, for a total of about 5.3 minutes on average.",

Shipwrecks generate in one of three ways: upright, keeled sideways, or upside-down. In many cases, they are missing their bow (front) or stern (rear), mast or multiple other blocks, giving them a damaged appearance; however, it is also possible, but rare, to find them completely intact. They consist solely of wooden materials, including logs/stripped logs, planks, fences, slabs, stairs, trapdoors, a door (if the ship is upright), and up to 3 chests, depending on rotation and intact sections of the ship. The bow is supposed to generate one chest (unless upside-down) while the stern should generate 2, and the whole ship generates a maximum of 3 chests, regardless of the ship's rotation or condition. However, there are some instances in which chests that usually generate in a shipwreck section are missing. Only two wood types are used per ship (one is the primary type, which is used by the logs and exterior, and the other the secondary type), but only 8 combinations are possible: Primary dark oak with secondary jungle and spruce, primary jungle with secondary spruce, primary oak with secondary birch and spruce, primary spruce with secondary dark oak, jungle, and oak.

Sea pickle colonies generate on the bottom of warm oceans and are found on top of coral blocks in coral reefs. Each chunk has chance to generate sea pickle colonies.

There were multiple prototypes for what ultimately became the warden. According to Jasper Boerstra, it went through 175 different concept iterations to ensure that the warden was \"something really special\". The very first warden iteration created was a modified cow that made the lights and torches flicker and served as the main prototype for the darkness effect. Some known concepts and names for the warden from this time were the \"shade\", the \"stalker\" and the \"hollowed\". The shade was a vaguely humanoid translucent mob with glowing eyes. It was meant to be a more ambient mob, which would stand in darkness with only its eyes visible and would slowly fade away as the player approached it. It would also imitate the noise of other mobs, making it sound as though they were right behind the player. Rather than an iteration on the warden, by then called the \"stalker\", the shade had come to be a completely separate mob to the stalker, though in some concepts it was meant to be sort of complementary, living in the ancient cities and helping the stalker by tricking players into alerting it. It was eventually scrapped due to a feeling that",

Special cases: chain armor can be repaired with iron ingots, turtle shells can be repaired with turtle scutes, maces can be repaired with breeze rods, and elytra can be repaired with phantom membranes. The repair does not need to be complete; one material repairs of the item's maximum durability. Repair of an unenchanted item can cost more material than simply crafting a new item or combining damaged items. The exception is armor, which consumes less material at the cost of experience levels. Repairing with a matching item works for any item with durability including bows, shears and so on. The items must be a matching tool and of a matching material. For example, a golden pickaxe cannot combine with a golden sword or iron pickaxe. In both cases, the resulting durability is limited to the item's maximum, and there is no discount for \"over-repair\". As a subset of repairing one item with another, the anvil can transfer enchantments from the sacrifice to the target.

Guardians and elder guardians attack squid in the same manner as they would a player, even if the squid is affected by Invisibility. Axolotls also attack squid. Squid are affected by the Impaling enchantment — because they are aquatic mobs; as long as they touch water. Squid produce a cloud of black ink particles and swim away when attacked. They also produce unique dark blue bubble particles when hit. The ink remains visible when the squid has the status effect. Squid sometimes accidentally beach themselves. If the player is in Spectator mode or is far away from a squid (often when it is in an unloaded chunk), it remains stationary. When attacked in this state, squid cannot flee. Like land-based mobs, squid can be picked up by a minecart. Unlike most 'animal' mobs, squid cannot breed. Baby squid can only be found when they naturally spawn.

Mineshafts are the only structures where cave spider monster spawners can be found. A unique variant of mineshafts made out of dark oak wood can generate on the surface in badlands biomes. Mineshafts generate underground in any Overworld biome except for the deep dark (although a mineshaft can overlap). They generate before chunk features such as ores. Multiple mineshafts can generate near each other, producing larger complexes. When mineshafts intersect with caves and canyons, corridors generate a bridge of planks over empty space, either suspended with iron chains above or supported by log pillars below. When a mineshaft intersects with an aquifer, a barrier of solid blocks generates to prevent fluids from flowing into the mineshaft, often resulting in corridors cut off from the rest of the mineshaft. Mineshafts often generate on the surface in badlands biomes. Badlands mineshafts are composed of dark oak planks and fences with railways more complete above ground. Since badlands biomes generate gold ore often and at higher altitudes, they are good places to easily find gold. Mineshafts are the most common generated structures in Minecraft.

Charge attacks have a longer recovery time after finishing or canceling a charge attack than lower tiered spears. Zombies, husks, zombified piglins, zombie villagers, and piglins wielding spears have unique attacking behavior. When attacking, they use the spear's charge attack while moving towards their target. They hold the charge through its full duration, using all 3 stages. Once the charge attack has ended, they walk away to increase the distance between them and their target before turning around to begin another charge. When wielded by any other mob, such as skeletons, they instead use the spear's jab attack when in melee range. The Lunge enchantment on the spear will take effect only for these mobs.",

And if the non-stackable item is pushed, the output power level increases to 4. The hopper is held deactivated by the powered dust when the circuit is off, and by the powered dropper when the circuit is on. But, when the input turns off, there is a brief 1-tick moment when the dropper has just turned off, but the torch attached to it hasn't turned on again. This allows the hopper to activate for 1 tick, pushing an item back into the dropper. A hopper always pushes items from its left slots first, so the hopper pushes back the item the dropper pushed into it, rather than any of the 16-stackable items in its far right slot, allowing the circuit to reset itself. Variations: The player can remove one of the items from the dropper to create a 2-RNG with different power level outputs than the regular 2-RNG: removing the 64-stackable item outputs power levels 2 or 4, removing the 16-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 4, and removing the non-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 2. You can add additional redstone dust leading from the hopper to a block next to it, and then down to the side of the comparator. This 2-wide variation keeps the comparator's output off while the input is off. With only three items in the dropper, all three output power levels are chosen with equal probability. The probability of the output levels can be changed by adding additional 64-stackable, 16-stackable, and non-stackable items to the dropper (which must all be different from each other so they don't stack). For example, with one 64-stackable item, one 16-stackable item, and two different non-stackable items, the RNG outputs power level 1 25% of the time, power level 2 25%",

If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and 1–3 lapis lazuli in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect. Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, while paying only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.

There are many different designs, but they are all based on the same general idea: a comparator is turned on while it should be turned off, or the other way around.

Up to three powered shelves can connect together to swap up to nine items at once. Shelves can be broken by hand, but using an axe is the fastest. , shelves cannot be moved by pistons. A shelf can store up to 3 item stacks. Each slot of the shelf can store a full stack of any stackable item, or just one of a non-stackable item. The number of items in the stack is not displayed. The shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an item frame. Interacting with any of the 3 slots swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot if it is not powered by redstone. While a shelf is powered by redstone, its front texture changes to show its powered state; when placed next to each other, up to three powered shelves can connect together. Powered shelves prioritize connecting to other shelves on the left. Powered shelves can be used to quickly swap the contents of a player's hotbar, similar to the Saved Hotbars function in Creative mode. Interacting with a single powered shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost slots in the hotbar. Interacting with two connected shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost slots in the hotbar. Interacting with three connected shelves swaps their contents with all 9 slots of the hotbar. It does not matter which of the connected shelves the player interacts with. Shelves can also act as power sources for redstone comparators depending on what slots contain an item. An item in the left slot will emit a redstone power of 1. An item in the middle slot will emit a redstone power of 2. An item in the right slot will emit a redstone power of 4. If multiple slots contain an item, the comparator will output the total, up to a maximum power of 7 if all slots are filled. Shelves can be filled automatically by using either hoppers or drop",

Each block of chorus plant has a 50% chance to drop a chorus fruit. This is not affected by Fortune. To eat chorus fruit, press and hold while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores hunger and 2.4 hunger saturation. Unlike most foods, chorus fruits can be eaten when the player has a full hunger bar. The player may also be teleported: up to 16 attempts are made to choose a random destination within ±8 on all three axes in the same manner as enderman teleportation, with the exception that the player may teleport into an area only 2 blocks high, or one block tall if the player is crawling. The player does not land in the average centroid of the block, but rather to any position within an 8-block range. If there are no valid blocks within this range, the teleportation attempt fails and the player remains in place. The player is teleported directly down to the ground regardless of the height it was used at if the player is too far from a valid destination. The chorus fruit, unlike an ender pearl, can teleport the player through solid blocks. The algorithm tries to avoid fluids; the player cannot teleport into a space occupied by water or lava. However, the player can be teleported onto dangerous blocks such as fire, cacti and magma blocks. If a teleport succeeds, a sound similar to an enderman teleporting plays originating from the teleportation origin location. Chorus fruit has a cooldown of 1 second before being able to be used again. The cooldown is represented by a white overlay on the chorus fruit in the hotbar.

Romeo is somewhat mentally unstable, as noted by Jesse in Giant Consequences; and is very capricious and erratic, as seen when he threatens to burn the Sunshine Institute to the ground simply because Jesse does not obey when he tries to pit them against Jack/Petra.

The stopping block can be any movable block exept slime and glazed teracotta. i just used honeyblocks because they are easy to break.\" --FirewolfQuasar Dimensions: 4x4*x4, JE 1.16+ Materials: 4 observers, 4 sticky pistons, 15* honey blocks. For seating: 1+ minecart(s), 1 rail, 1 block(temporary). Important note: The build is directional and must be built aligned per the schematic with N facing north. This is a restriction due to the update order of the blocks. This build does not work with slime blocks. # Place all the honey blocks and sticky pistons first. # Install the observers. With honey block B (the brake) in place, the pistons don't push if they receive a redstone pulse. # The optional minecart can be added, by placing any temporary block at T, placing the rail on it, then the cart. Mine block T and recover it and the rail. This need not be slime as pictured, it just mines quickly. # Options: The honey blocks marked * are optional. If they are in place, any movable block except slime and glazed terracotta can be used to stop by placing it at B. If the * honey blocks aren't used, the piston push limit isn't exceeded, so the brake B block must be a honey block to restrict the pistons. Honey blocks mine easily and have a high rate of recovery in this design, so do make for an effective brake. Usage: Stand on the north-west honey block (or sit in the minecart). Take note of the pistons and choose the one that pushes in the direction you wish to travel. Then update its respective observer. Place a torch, button, or other disposable block on the face or otherwise trigger the observer. The disposable item breaks or is abandoned when the observer is moved",

It is used to till dirt-related blocks into farmland, and to break leaves, haybales, and sculk-related blocks faster. It is the second-highest tier of hoe, having higher mining efficiency, attack speed, and durability than an iron hoe. It can be upgraded into a netherite hoe using a netherite ingot and netherite upgrade at a smithing table. Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability. Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise. Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe. Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled. Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item. Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block. Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt. Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only damage . , hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon. , diamond hoes have an attack speed modifier 0 (refill in 0.25s). Hoes always attack instantly .

The price of an item can rise and fall with changes in demand. The price of a traded item can rise when next resupplied, or fall from a risen price if not traded. Demand is stored per item, not per villager. When a player holds an emerald or other item near a villager who wants that item, the villager holds up an item it offers in exchange. , villagers raise their arms when showing trade items. For example, a farmer villager who buys 20 wheat for one emerald holds up an emerald, offering it to a player holding wheat. If the villager has more than one trade for an item, it cycles through the trades, offering a different item every few seconds. This kind of trading interaction makes it easier to find villagers who offer a particular trade, but the player must still open the trading interface to complete the trade. Note that villagers do not hold items to offer trades during their gather or sleep phases, even though it is still possible to trade with them. Villagers do not offer trades that are currently out of stock. Villagers have various professions that progress through experience-based levels, unlocking new trade tiers. To rank up a villager, the player needs to trade.

A live fish can be captured by using a water bucket on a fish, to obtain a bucket of fish, which is the only way to obtain the live mob in item form. Using the bucket of fish on a water source block transfers the fish from the bucket to the body of water. A water bucket may also be used on axolotls and tadpoles in this manner. Fish exist in several different item forms. Upon death, fish drop their item form equivalent (cooked if on fire), with a chance to drop a bone or bone meal. Various fish can be found in different ocean biomes, but only salmon appear in rivers. Fish can also spawn in player-created bodies of water, as long as they are within a river or ocean biome. In Java Edition, fish can spawn inside a water block at Y-level 50 to 63 (from 13 blocks below sea level up to inside the block one above it), that also has water above and below it. The spawn block and the block below can be any kind of water, such as a source block, falling water, bubble column, kelp, or even a waterlogged block (as long as the fish can be placed at the bottom center of the spawn block without colliding with anything solid). The block above must be pure water, such as a source block, falling water, or flowing water of any depth. Particularly, the block above cannot also be a bubble column, so fish no longer spawn inside bubble elevators. Bedrock Edition does permit fish to spawn in bubble columns. Fish can spawn between 24 and 64 block spherical range away from the player. Fish can despawn at a range of 40 blocks or more from the player, and instantly despawn more than 64 blocks away, except when spawned using a bucket of fish.",

Any undead mobs that receive Fire Resistance do not take damage from exposure to sunlight. , Fire Resistance also prevents the affected targets from catching fire, which stops the fire itself from covering the player's screen. In Java Edition, Fire Resistance does not prevent the affected target from catching fire, but it does prevent any damage that would normally be taken due to being set on fire. This can cause the player (or mob) to start taking damage if the effect expires before said player/mob is able to put themselves out. Fire Resistance allows snow golems to survive in hot biomes. The wither and ender dragon are immune to this status effect. Many Nether mobs (blazes, ghasts, magma cubes, striders, wither skeletons, zoglins, zombified piglins) are naturally resistant to fire and lava, and are unaffected by the Fire Resistance status effect.

Huge crimson fungus trunks can be either thick or thin: thick trunks grow up in a 3×3-plus shape, with stray stems sometimes in the corners, while thin trunks grow straight up as a 1×1 column. To determine the size of huge crimson fungi, a random integer is chosen between 4 and 13 [inclusive]. There is then a chance of that integer doubling. The resulting value is the height of the trunk. A layer of wart blocks and shroomlights is then spread around the trunk, being able to generate up to 3 blocks out from the trunk, and are the \"leaves\" of the fungus. There is a 3×3×2 hollow ring that surrounds the lowest block of a fungus where no blocks generate. Both variants have shroomlights generate inside them, replacing both the wart blocks and stems.

Incidentally, adders that calculate carries one at a time in this fashion are called Ripple Carry adders. One of the simplest and most classic ways of solving the ripple carry problem is to use instant AND gates that use pistons. These adders are simple and fast, but are inconstant because they use pistons. When blocks are accidentally dropped, the entire circuit breaks. Pistons also have timing awkwardness that can be excruciatingly inconvenient when building an advanced circuit that relies heavily on timing. Whenever a carry is created, it is sent through the wire with the lever on it, and, instead of going through an AND gate, the piston retracts and the carry can move on to the next bit, which adds no carry propagation delay at all (until the signal strength runs out). This video shows a straightforward implementation of the logic. The design is large and spread out, so it's easy to see each individual part of the adder and the carry logic. Gates: XNOR (7), IMPLIES (4), NOT (4), OR (3), AND (3) Note! The least significant digit (\"ones\" digit) is on the left of the diagram so that the progression from half adder to the full adders can be seen more clearly. Reverse the diagram if you want a conventional left to right input. This adder takes two 4-bit numbers (A and B) and adds them together, producing a sum (S) bit for each bit added and a carry (C) for the whole sum. The sum bits are in the same order as the input bits, which on the diagram means that the leftmost S output is the least significant digit of the answer. This is just an example of a string of adders; adders can be strung in this way to add bigger numbers as well. The same function but a different design with 4 full adders instead of 1 half adder and 3 full adders NOTE: switches are inputs A and B (top switch C input) Subtracting and adding are the same thing when ",

If a tool with Fortune is used, it has a higher chance of dropping a large amount of glowstone dust—but never more than 4. Glowstone only occurs naturally in the Nether, where it generates in crystalline blobs on the underside of ceilings or overhangs. They can be found in every Nether biome, although they are significantly rarer in soul sand valleys, because the ceiling of this biome is made of soul sand or soul soil below which glowstone blobs cannot generate. They can still occasionally generate in caves and canyons in this biome, because the ceiling is made of netherrack. Glowstone can also generate as a part of hoglin stable bastion remnants. Witches may drop glowstone dust, which can be crafted into glowstone. Journeyman Clerics always sell one glowstone for 4 emeralds, and wandering traders occasionally sell one glowstone for 2 emeralds.

You need to have a piston push a block over the sensor. It detects the change in light and emits a Redstone pulse. This design is extendable upward as far as you want, but you need to have the original hole open to sunlight. It also works only during the day, because it uses shadows to activate. An observer can be used to detect the block update that occurs when a water source changes to a bubble column (or vice versa). When swapping the block below a column of water sources to soul sand or a magma block from some other block, the entire column immediately changes to bubble column blocks. This can be used to quickly transmit a redstone signal upward to an observer facing the top water source/bubble column block. A setup that can carry a pulse signal downward across any distance involves walls of any type, a piston, and an observer. When a wall block has a solid block on two opposing sides and non-solid blocks (e.g., air) on the other two sides, it takes a flat shape. This is vertically repeatable up to any height. However, when a wall/solid block is placed into one of the two air blocks around a flat wall, the flat wall block and every flat wall block below it are updated to a different version of the wall with a column in the middle. This update is instant and can be detected by an observer watching any flat wall in the tower. The update can be made repeatable by having a regular piston face the flat wall at the top of the tower, since the piston head also triggers the wall update.

A redstone comparator with no powered sides outputs the same signal strength as its rear input, with a 1 tick delay. A redstone comparator in comparison mode (front torch down and unpowered) compares its rear input to its two side inputs. If either side input is greater than the rear input, the comparator output turns off. If neither side input is greater than the rear input, the comparator outputs the same signal strength as its rear input. The formula for calculating the output signal strength is as follows: output = rear × [left ≤ rear AND right ≤ rearWikipedia:Iverson bracket|] A redstone comparator in subtraction mode (front torch up and powered) subtracts the signal strength of the higher side input from the signal strength of the rear input. output = max(rear − max(left, right), 0) For example: if the signal strength is 6 at the left input, 7 at the right input and 4 at the rear, the output signal has a strength of max(4 − max(6, 7), 0) = max(4−7, 0) = max(−3, 0) = 0.

A warden also periodically sniffs the area around it, allowing it to zero in on targets even if they don't create vibrations. As wardens sniff, pick up vibrations, or are touched by other players or mobs, they become increasingly agitated. A warden, whether angered or not, gives 13 seconds of Darkness to all players within a 20 block ovoid radius of it every 6 seconds. The souls in its chest make a low heartbeat that occurs in tandem with the Darkness effect. The heartbeat speeds up as the warden becomes increasingly agitated. Wardens keep track of how angry they are at each suspect as a number from 0 to 150. When a warden notices a vibration, it adds anger to the player or mob that caused the vibration. It adds 10 anger if the vibration was from a projectile or 35 anger for other vibrations. However, if two projectiles from the same player/mob are heard by the warden within five seconds, it instead adds the full 35 anger toward that player/mob. Wardens do not add anger toward a mob/player if the projectile was shot from more than 30 blocks away, although the projectile does count toward the counter of two projectiles. Anger decays at a rate of 1 per second and immediately clears if the targeted player switches to Creative or Spectator modes, the target or warden leaves the dimension, or if the target dies. A warden adds 35 anger toward any mob that directly touches it. This effect has a 1-second cooldown. When it finishes sniffing, a warden adds 35 anger to the nearest mob or player within a 6 block radius horizontally and 20 blocks vertically, a cylindrical volume centered on the warden.

The outfits available are the following: Villagers have 13 professions and 2 non professions for a total of 15 outfits: Trades crops and natural foods, such as bread and cookies. Fisherman (fisher hat) Trades campfires and fishing items. Shepherd (brown hat with white apron) Trades shears, wool, dyes, paintings and beds. Fletcher (hat with feather and quiver on the back) Trades bows, crossbows, all types of arrows (except luck) and archery ingredients. Cleric (purple apron and creeper cloak) Trades magic items like ender pearls, redstone dust, glowstone dust, and other enchanting or potion ingredients. Weaponsmith (eyepatch and black apron) Trades minerals, bells and enchanted melee weapons. The axe enchantments are weapon related, such as Sharpness or Smite. Armorer (welding mask) Trades foundry items and sells chain, iron and enchanted diamond armor tiers. Toolsmith (black apron) Trades minerals, bells and harvest tools. The axe enchantments are tool related. Librarian (eyeglasses and a book as a hat) Trades enchanted books, clocks, compasses, name tags, glass, ink sacs, lanterns, and book and quills.

Naturally found powerful potatoes have the age parameter set to 3, and a number of weak roots growing down from the block into the terrain of Potato dimension. They don't grow further. When mined and replaced, the age parameter is reset to 0. Every time the block receives a random tick, it attempts to grow strong roots instead of weak roots - both downward and to the sides.

Afterward, it checks if the block above it is a type of container. If so, it attempts to pull from it. Otherwise, the hopper attempts to collect item entities. Notably, hoppers can push to and pull from other hoppers, forming hopper pipes or hopper chains, which allow transporting items across several blocks and are further discussed below. When a hopper receives a redstone signal, all three of its functions stop: in this situation the hopper is locked/disabled. Once the hopper loses power, its activity resumes as it goes back to being unlocked/enabled. Depowering a locked hopper does not affect its cooldown time. Therefore, unlocking a hopper that was not already in cooldown results in it starting to pull, push, or collect items as soon as it gets ticked. While a locked hopper does not push or pull/collect items, it may still receive items from droppers, crafters and other hoppers, and may have its items pulled out by another hopper beneath it.

These monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly invert, with natural terrain generation replacing the air/water up to the height limit and vice versa. Monoliths would generate in seemingly random locations throughout the world. They tended to generate around flattish terrain. They were caused by an error in the Perlin noise generator. Specifically, the hilliness of the terrain (the \"terrain scale\") was controlled by a noise map. The reciprocal of the value of this noise was then used as the intensity of a gradient applied to the terrain. Because the reciprocal is used, flatter terrain is caused by lower values (where the terrain bias gradient drops off faster), and hillier terrain is caused by higher values. Because the reciprocals of small negative numbers are very large negative numbers, the terrain abruptly changes when zero is crossed, causing the gradient to bias higher elevations toward being ground, and lower elevations toward being air. Thus, when terrain scale becomes negative, terrain generates upside-down, generating monoliths. This was possible in early Alpha because the noise map that determined terrain scale could return a negative value. (This may be the same 2d noise map used in Classic, where adding multiple octaves together could result in unpredictably high or low values.) The monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly generate up to the height limit, with natural grass block and ore generation. They could theoretically generate arbitrarily tall, being stopped only by the height limit, which - at this point in the game's development - was 128 blocks. The area below the monoliths was completely hollow, except for water generating at sea level and a layer of bedrock at the bottom, making the normal terrain seem like inverse monoliths.

It can be triggered by placing a block atop the pistons, or by switches at the stations. The harvested crops are launched at some speed, so this design may be better for an enclosed farm. Extensions are mechanical parts of a fully-automatic flying machine used to push an independent part of a large flying structure. A single piston only can push or pull up to 12 blocks. Extensions use additional pistons to \"extend\" a slime structure by allowing more blocks to be pushed. A one-way extension has 2 parts: a normal piston in the rear, and a slime block (or more) with a power source in the front with space between them. Once the rear part with the piston is pushed, the piston is activated by a power source from the front part. It pushes the slime block (and thus the next part of the flying contraption and its extensions), which pulls the power source with it. The piston then deactivates and prepares for another push. Some simple engines are just made of looped extensions, such that, at any given time one piston is always powered (in these machines it is important to place the redstone blocks last). A two-way extension consists of an observer powering at least one sticky piston which pushes or pulls a part of the flying contraption. This is possible only in Java Edition because it's the only version where sticky pistons (upon receiving a short redstone pulse) can push a block and then retract quickly without pulling it back.

The \"C4 trap\" is a vertical or horizontal stack of TNT with a button wired to a dispenser with a fire charge in it. The dispenser is placed one block above or below the stack (vertical) or one block next to the stack (horizontal). This usually works better for demolition than for a trap. If you want to use it as a trap, wire a pressure plate to the dispenser. This works similarly to a flaming arrow hitting a stack of TNT from above. This works better than a dispenser shooting TNT, because the \"C4\" stays in one place. Also, if only two TNT blocks are used, it works well as a disposable cannon, even better on obsidian blocks, but not in a tube. All evidence of the trap is usually destroyed. Note: C4 trap from below does not work well. This requires a redstone comparator, TNT, a furnace and something to smelt. Place the furnace, and then put the comparator directly behind it. Then, put the TNT behind the comparator. When an item is added to the furnace, the TNT will explode. An alternative is a similar design but with a redstone torch to invert the signal, and at least one item already in the furnace. When the item is removed, the TNT will explode.

If a villager cannot pathfind to its claimed site, both the site block and villager emit anger particles. The site block may need to be broken or interacted by a piston before the villager unclaims it. Villagers can store memories about players in the form of gossip. These get spread to other villagers whenever they talk with each other. Each piece of gossip is one of five types, and it stores a value as well as a target. Gossips generate and increase in value as a result of various player actions. The target is the player who caused the gossip. Together the gossip values determine a player's reputation with villagers, which influences trading prices and the hostility of naturally spawned iron golems. Trading with or curing a villager increases the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager only. When a villager is attacked or killed, however, it instead generates the major negative gossip in every other villager with whom it has eye-to-eye line of sight inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions. When a piece of gossip is shared, it is received at a lower value than the sharer has it. Gossips also decay a certain amount (see Decay column) every 20 minutes. Since major positive gossip has a share penalty >= its max value and a decay of 0, it cannot be shared and never decays. A player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by its respective multiplier and adding the results together. For example, if a player has recently cured a villager for the first time but has also attacked the villager twice, the player's reputation with that villager would be 5×20 + 25 - 50 = 75.

Spruce trees, sugar cane, poppies, dandelions, and short grass can appear under such an occasion. Like in typical biomes, lava lakes and ruined portals generate. Because the whole biome experiences snowfall, lightning typically doesn't (that is, without using a Channeling trident or summon command) strike within it. The spikes are an excellent source of packed ice, which can be used for faster transportation, e.g. an unmeltable ice track for boats. The sky uses a unique gray/blue color with Vibrant Visuals. Slightly stronger volumetric fog and changed lighting effects make the biome look more faded and gray in general.

If an empty bucket is in the fuel slot of a furnace when a wet sponge finishes smelting and becomes a dry sponge, the bucket fills with water. Other fuel items have to be used to smelt the wet sponge before the empty bucket is inserted. If a lava bucket is used as the fuel, it fills with water when the sponge dries out, meaning an empty bucket does not need to be inserted separately. a water bucket on a solid block places a water source block against that block, emptying the bucket; using a water bucket on a waterloggable block waterlogs the block.

Because this design uses flying machines and water, it can be expanded infinitely, but the time taken to print increases quadratically because of the way the flying machines are designed. The design is unique in that the stock can be any color. When a specific color is needed, the stock color is sent through a color-converter to get the desired color.

It is the highest tier of hoe, having higher mining efficiency, durability, damage and enchantability than a diamond hoe. Like other diamond tools, a diamond hoe can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its durability and mining efficiency, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability. Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise. Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe. Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled. Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item. Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block. Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.

      "chunk_text": "Erosions, also known as basins, are rare terrain features that strip away the top layer of a biomes surface, leaving a one-block deep hole with a stony floor. They can generate in all three dimensions, and are intentional. In the Overworld, the floors of erosions are always replaced with stone. They expose ores such as coal ore, copper ore and iron ore. In badlands erosions, gold ore can also be seen. Erosions in The Nether replace the floor with netherrack. Nether erosions can expose ore such as nether gold ore and nether quartz ore. Because erosions generate independent of the y-axis, if an erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang. Since erosions generate before features, chorus plants can take root in End erosions. The floor of End erosions is always end stone. When the game generates new chunks, the surface depth is calculated for every column inside the chunk based on the minecraft:surface noise. This value is an integer, and when it is less than or equal to 0, the top block from the surface is replaced with air. Note that because surface depth is calculated per-column, every surface in the column is removed; that is, an identical erosion appears above or below another one if there is an overhang. The surface depth rarely reaches these values, eliciting the rarity of erosions. After the hole is generated, the floor is replaced with a stone block of the respective dimension, and the hole is flooded with water if it is at or below sea level. Erosion generation occurs before carver creation in the terrain generation process, meaning that caves, features, and structures can disrupt or even completely conceal them. As a consequence, ore blobs are commonly found in erosions, making ore more accessible to players on the surface.",

The strength of the input signal in these circuits usually doesn't matter. When an input or output supplies a redstone signal, it is usually just referred to as \"on\", and when there is no signal, it is referred to as \"off\". For example, an AND gate takes two redstone signals as input, and outputs a redstone signal only if both inputs are greater than 0. That is, an AND gate is on only when both inputs are on. In electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in Minecraft, all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results. A NOT gate (aka \"inverter\") is on if its input is off. The simplest NOT gate is an input signal with a redstone torch attached. An OR gate is on if any of its inputs are on. The simplest OR gate is to feed multiple input signals together into a single block or redstone wire. A NOR gate is on only if none of its inputs are on. The simplest NOR gate is to feed multiple input signals into a block with a redstone torch attached. An AND gate is on only if all of its inputs are on. The simplest AND gate is to add redstone torches in front of each input to a NOR gate. A NAND gate is on if any of its inputs are off. The simplest NAND gate is to remove the final redstone torch from an AND gate. An XOR gate is on if its inputs are different. An XNOR gate is on if its inputs are equal. An IMPLY gate is on unless the first input is on and the second input is off.

A two's complement is when you invert the binary number (so that all the 0s are 1s and 1s are 0s) and add one to it. Example: do 10 subtract 9 This poses the complexity of signed numbers. This is a weight to the binary number to assign it as a positive or negative number. Whether the result is a negative or positive number is determined by the overflow flag. If there is an overflow, this means that the number is positive and otherwise, negative. To implement this, you can ask the ALU to do 3 operations. To do A subtract B, the operations are Multiplication is repeated addition, so the easiest (inefficiently) is to add A to a variable B amount of times. Here's pseudomachine code for it JUMP IF (B > 0) TO LINE 2 However, there are more efficient ways of multiplication. A good method is to repeatedly bitshift the first number to the location of ea",

Each time the kelp grows in height by one block, the newly generated top of the kelp plant increases its age by 1. When the top block of the kelp plant reaches an age of 25, it stops growing. This means that kelp can naturally grow to a height between 2 (if the first kelp plant had an age of 24) and 26 blocks (if the first kelp plant had an age of 0).

It is possible to use this mechanic to cultivate a kelp plant to increase its growth height beyond its natural maximum height of 26 blocks.

Flying machines are much more restricted due to the lack of quasi-connectivity and other piston behaviors. , a sticky piston powered with a 1 tick pulse drops the block it is carrying. The absence of these behaviors makes it difficult to create complex flying machines. These are basic flying machine designs. The shown examples move to the viewer's left. Removing the block of redstone, or placing obsidian in front of the observer, causes the machine to stop. This may be hard to do, unless in creative mode. For players who want to ride their flying machine, it may be hard to add and remove the obsidian or redstone block (especially in survival mode). A slightly easier way is to add layers of another material (such as wood plank) to the machine, stopping just before the limit of what a piston can move and doubling as a practical gondola for the player at the same time. From a position sitting on the machine somewhere, the player may add another wood plank block to the machine, killing the speed. Removing the final block causes the machine to start again. Simple engine 2The simple engine 2 provides a narrower but longer design, which requires less redstone than others (less redstone blocks). In this example, the machine would begin moving to the left once the observer on the right is activated. This can be done with a redstone pulse, or just lighting the face with flint and steel. To reverse the direction of this machine, simply move one of the slime blocks to the back, and switch the piston and sticky piston.

This is where the information resides. For example, the CU asks for the address of the byte living in 0001. It sends the address (0001) through the address bus and the RAM will return the value of the byte through the first bus. 0001 is the location of the byte, not the value of it. The fourth bus is the control bus, which the CU will communicate with the RAM with. For example, one wire could tell the RAM to set the byte to the value to the data sent to it by the CU. Another wire could tell the RAM to get the byte from the address sent to it by the CU. The fifth bus is another control bus, linking with the ALU, which sends flags from the ALU.

Making the dispenser shoot multiple snowballs is recommended. Place the piston so it pushes the block the signs are on. The player can make up to twelve rows using one piston. Make sure there is a block of empty space at the end of where the piston pushes. Connect the piston to a trigger, such a pressure plate or lever, and when the piston moves it should break the signs and cause the sand to fall along with the target. It is also possible to do this by pushing a line of blocks with torches or buttons on them, which may be slightly cheaper. Alternatively, use a sticky piston connected to a NOT gate which retracts a block with a sign on it, which allows the player to use more than 12 rows. Make what is shown in the schematic, a water elevator with water only on the top block. Make sure the hole is 30-40 blocks deep, which is enough to kill the player. It could help to place a lure sign near the 'elevator' saying something like \"Do not enter!\" You can also make the signs' text something like a floor countdown like \"35\", \"34\", \"33\", etc. so players are more likely to fall for the trap. If they want, you can place hoppers with chests so you can gather the loot from the victims, but if they really want the drops, they will need a secret passage to the bottom of the pit for collection. A false-floor trap is a variation of a pitfall trap. It works by creating a concealed safe route through the pitfall to allow authorized players to pass, while catching unauthorized players or mobs and killing them. It generally works best when there is no way around, forcing the player to pass through the trap. # Dig a pit. The deeper and longer the better. # Place TNT to build a bridge across the pit. It should be at least 2 blocks wide, preferably more as someone could cheat otherwise. # Replace some of the TNT ",

Water has a high blast resistance, causing it to absorb any normal blasts, with the exception of explosions from underwater TNT or placing a falling block on top of a regular TNT block and then lighting it.

When a dry sponge comes into contact with a water source or flowing block, it becomes a wet sponge, absorbing all water within 3 to 5 blocks in all directions. Kelp and lily pads within the absorbed water blocks are destroyed and drop as items, and seagrass is destroyed without dropping anything. Mobs that take damage out of water are affected as a side-effect. Sponges do not absorb water from waterlogged blocks, nor water that comes into contact by flowing back in from outside the area of absorption. For instance, placing a sponge 4 or more blocks from a single water source removes the flowing water in the area of effect, but as the flow from the source resumes it is not affected by the wet sponge. A sponge instantly absorbs nearby water when it is placed next to water or when water comes into contact with it (by being placed next to the sponge, or by flowing toward it).

      "chunk_text": "A JK latch has two inputs: J, which turns the circuit ON, K which turns the circuit OFF; if J and K are both ON, then the circuit toggles its output. These circuits also often have a clock (C) input that determines when the circuit is allowed to change its output. (J and K do not have common names like set, reset, toggle, etc. do). Unlike T flip-flops and RS latches, which can hold two states (ON or OFF), a counter can be designed to hold a greater number of states. Many other memory circuits are possible. Pistons allow players to design circuits that are smaller and/or faster than the standard, redstone-only counterparts. An understanding of standard redstone circuits is helpful, as this tutorial is focused on the circuit design rather than the function. The main components here are sticky pistons, regular pistons, redstone wire, repeaters and redstone torches. There are several benefits of piston circuitry: Neither repeaters nor pistons 'burn out', unlike redstone torches. Piston circuits are often (not always) smaller and/or faster than their redstone counterparts. This allows building devices such as fast clocks and \"instant\" signal transmission. Pistons' ability to move blocks within the world makes them a natural for memory circuits, as well as the obvious doorways and switchable bridges. With slime or honey blocks involved, entire structures can \"get up and move\" (see also tutorial on flying machines). Piston circuits can sharply reduce the use of redstone in favor of wood, stone, and iron. These circuits aren't generally needed for redstone projects, but might find use in complex projects, proofs of concept, and thought experiments. Some examples: ;Multiplexers and relays A multiplexer is an advanced form of logic gate that chooses which of two inputs to let through as output based on an additional input (for example, if input A is ON then output input B, otherwise output input C).

If Flame is applied to a crossbow by use of commands or an anvil in Creative, the enchantment causes the weapon to set targets on fire when using arrows as ammo, but not when using firework rockets as ammo. If Flame is applied to a trident by use of commands or an anvil in Creative, the enchantment cause the weapon's thrown projectile to ignite TNT, TNT minecarts, candles, and campfires, but not entities.",

Kelp can be cooked in a furnace, smoker, or campfire. Each piece of dried kelp removed from a furnace output slot gives 0.1 experience (6.4 experience per stack). To eat dried kelp, press and hold while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores hunger and 0.6 / 0.2 hunger saturation. A player can consume dried kelp in 0.8 seconds which is about twice as fast as any other food item in the game. Dried kelp placed into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.",
