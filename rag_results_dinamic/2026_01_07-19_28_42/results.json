      "chunk_text": "If none of the above conditions are true, the witch defaults to using a splash potion of Harming, which does magical damage. A witch can choose to equip and drink a potion each game tick ( second) if it is not already drinking a potion. Drinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds and slows down its moving speed a little. The witch does not attack during this time. When the hitbox of the witch is 80% under water and the witch is lacking the Water Breathing status effect, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Water Breathing. When the witch is on fire or the last damage taken by it in the past two seconds was fire damage, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Fire Resistance. When the witch is not at full health, there is a 5% chance of drinking a potion of Healing which heals . When the witch is eleven or more blocks from a target and does not have the Speed effect, there is a 50% chance of drinking a potion of Swiftness. Witches still can be killed through suffocation, cacti, or wither roses, but due to their frequent use of potions of Healing, this requires constant damage output for 40–50 seconds. Additionally, witches cannot drown or die from fire unless they already are at low health. Witches usually die in lava, even at full health, when drinking a potion of Healing first instead of potion of Fire Resistance. When in a raid, if all the villagers in a village die or all the village beds are destroyed, witches jump and play unique sound effects in commemoration to their victory. , witches attack iron golems and snow golems or any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers, throwing harmful splash potions. , witches drink a beneficial potion, often an instant-health healing potion, when they are attacked by evoker fangs, illager mobs or harming potions from other witches and join an illager patrol if sufficiently near to the pillager, vindicator, evoker and illusioner patrol captain mobs. Witches have entity data associated with them that contains various properties. See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.",
