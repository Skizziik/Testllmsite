Adult pigs are a source of porkchops and can be ridden using a saddle and a carrot on a stick. They have three variants based on the temperature of the biome they spawn in. Pigs spawn in the Overworld in most grassy biomes except for snowy plains, meadows, mangrove swamps, and pale gardens. , pigs spawn in groups of 4 on grass blocks. Individual pigs rarely may spawn on grass after world generation. , pigs spawn in groups of 1 to 3 on grass blocks. Individuals regularly spawn on grass after world generation. Each pig has a 5% chance of spawning as a baby. Pigs sometimes also spawn in animal pens, stables, and butcher house backyards in villages upon world generation. Pigs cannot spawn naturally with a saddle. Pigs have 3 variants: temperate, cold, and warm. This variant is determined by the biome the pig spawns in and does not impact their behavior. If a pig spawn egg is used in any biome not listed, a temperate pig is spawned. Successfully breeding two adult pigs result in orbs. experience orbs if killed by a player or tamed wolf. Killing a baby pig yields neither items nor experience. Pigs roam the Overworld avoiding hazards and harmful falls. A pig flees for a short time when harmed. Pigs follow players holding carrots, potatoes, beetroots or carrots on sticks within a radius of six blocks. Pigs can be bred using carrots, potatoes or beetroots. After breeding, the parents have a cooldown of 5 minutes before they can breed again. Baby pigs mature in 20 minutes and stay near their parents. Feeding them reduces the remaining time to maturity by 10%. When two different variants of pigs are bred together, the variant of the baby is randomly selected from one of the parents' variants. When a pig or baby pig is struck by lightning, it transforms into a zombified piglin or baby zombified piglin, respectively. If lightning strikes a pig in Peaceful difficulty, the pig does not transform but takes normal damage from the strike. If the pig was equipped with a saddle, the saddle is lost. If a player was riding the pig, they are kept mounted on the zombified piglin , while they are dismounted.

They can also be designed to carry along a player and/or other entities, which may be riding in a minecart or towed along by honey blocks. They can also be crouching on honey blocks to stick onto them. The mechanics of such machines vary slightly between the Java and Bedrock Editions of Minecraft; This guide covers Java Edition and Bedrock Edition in separate sections. The key blocks for flying machines, more or less in order of appearance: Pistons are capable of pushing (and for sticky pistons pulling) up to 12 blocks. These can simply be arranged in a line in front of the piston, but slime and honey blocks allow carrying along blocks placed to all sides of that line. Various immovable blocks (notably obsidian and tile entities such as furnaces) provide limits and frameworks. Redstone Blocks: The key point here is while most other redstone power sources are partial blocks that get broken by pistons, this one can be pushed or pulled by pistons, so a machine can carry its own power source. Observers are sensors for both the environment and adjacent parts of the same machine, which can also turn a change in one part of the machines into power elsewhere. Slime and Honey blocks are similar: both can \"stick to\" other blocks at their sides, carrying those along with them when pushed or pulled by a piston. Their differences are as follows: They do not stick to each other. Slime blocks are solid blocks, which can take and transmit a redstone signal, while honey blocks are transparent blocks which cannot. Slime blocks bounce entities away from them, while honey blocks drag entities along with them (and prevent players or mobs atop them from jumping high). There are two main components of slime block flying machines: The engine provides the basic control and motion, based on the idea that a slime block pushed by a piston moves adjacent movable blocks, including other slime blocks, when pushed or pulled. However, each piston is limited to moving 12 blocks total. Extensions uses additional pistons to let tow along additional segments of a larger machine. Honey blocks can also be used to bypass the piston push limit by using adjacent slime block and honey block flying machines to divide the number of blocks in a structure among pistons. In Bedrock Edition, extensions are divided into leading and trailing types. Note that the schematics in this section use the usual building scheme where layer 1 (or occasionally layer 0) is the bottom layer.

Mobs can spawn anywhere in this range that is suitable, with mobs more likely to spawn closer to the monster spawner than farther away. While mobs are spawned at fractional x and z-coordinates (i.e. not aligned to blocks), they are spawned at an integer y-coordinate. Horizontally, a mob can spawn with its center point anywhere within range, but vertically, mobs spawn with their legs at either the same layer as the monster spawner block, one block above it, or one block below it. (Note that when there are other blocks slightly intersecting the mob's hitbox, they can sometimes glitch further away - often up - but this does not make it a true spawning point.) A monster spawner attempts to spawn 4 mobs at randomly chosen points within the spawning volume, then waits anywhere from 200 to 799 ticks (10 to 39.95 seconds) before spawning again. As it waits, the mob model inside the block spins faster and faster. Except for the normal solid-block spawning requirement, all the remaining ones must be met (not in a solid block, correct light level, etc.), so the monster spawner often produces fewer than 4 mobs.

This page is a list of basic traps with a short tutorial that often assumes the reader has a working understanding of the basic concepts required to build the trap. Most traps are considered to be mechanisms, though some are not classified as such. Traps are devices designed to trap or damage entities, often referred to as targets. Traps are often made up of 3 components: A lure, a trigger, and the damage source. In a simple landmine, the lure could be a base behind the landmine, the trigger a pressure plate, the damage source TNT. Not all traps have a lure, they may rely on chance or something else to lure the target. Feel free to add any ideas of traps you have here. Just follow the style guide and everyone will have new strategies to remove their enemies. A list of components for a good trap can be seen below: These components are a trigger that allows the rest of the trap to work. Pressure plates are commonly used to detect whether an entity or item presses on it. There are 4 variants (wooden pressure plate, stone pressure plate, light weighted pressure plate, and heavily weighted pressure plate.)

Works best when paired with an observer. Stone pressure plates measure only players and mobs and give out maximum signal strength. The second most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect only a player or mob. Works best when paired with an observer. Light-weighted pressure plates measure all entities, and the strength increases as more entities are added. Useful if you want to detect a specific number of entities. Works better with only redstone dust if the pressure plate is for detecting entities and not players. Heavy-weighted pressure plates are similar to a light weighted pressure plate but they measure groups of 10 entities per redstone comparator output. Observers are most commonly used to detect whether a block state changes (ie: an ore trap). They are useful if you want to kill someone destroying a block in your base, a TNT lighting, redstone getting activated, containers being opened, furnaces turning on or off, etc. String, when connected to a pair of tripwire hooks or an observer, can detect when a player/mob steps through it or breaks it. It is also difficult to see. When a player/mob/item comes in contact with a string connected to 2 tripwire hooks, it will output a redstone signal. Can detect all entities Wide range of detection Hooks can be seen easily when placed on a wall String connected to it can be broken with shears without outputting a signal When a button is pressed, it outputs a redstone signal. Useful for redstone control rooms. It detects the 'time' of Minecraft day. It can be right clicked to detect sun or moon.",

Since badlands biomes generate gold ore often and at higher altitudes, they are good places to easily find gold. Mineshafts are the most common generated structures in Minecraft. Starting point: a 10×10 parlor, with an arched ceiling and one to four exits in each direction. Corridors: some 3×3 tunnels and junctions are supported by planks and fences. Some places are decorated with torches and cobwebs. On long corridors, these supports are placed four blocks away from each other, while some have missing planks which may be filled up with cobwebs or blocks of stone jutting out from the top. The tunnels are connected by incomplete rail systems on the ground, upon which minecarts with chests generate uncommonly. Cobwebs do not generate if they would not be connected to solid blocks, while corridors generate with log pillars, iron chains, and fences for support if they are in mid-air. Crossings: dual-floor, 5×5 intersections supported by wooden columns. Staircases: diagonal tunnels, stairs blocks are not used. Abandoned passageways: accessory corridors with numerous cobwebs concealing cave spider monster spawners. Any chest found in a mineshaft always occurs as a minecart with chest that rests on top of some rails.

Taming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding. , a player mounts a horse by pressing on it with an empty hand. , the player can also hold an object that cannot be used on a horse. An adult horse can be tamed by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking the player off. Taming depends on the horse's \"temper\". Horses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0–99 is chosen. The horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold. Otherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse. Temper can also be increased by feeding the horse. After repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed. , like all tame animals, a death message is displayed to every player when a horse is killed. Feeding two tamed horses golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a baby. The baby appears more spindly than adult horses and , will visibly grow in stages to full size with time. The baby can be fed to make it mature faster. Depending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types. Bred with a horse: breeding two horses produces a baby horse. Usually, the new baby has the color and markings of one of its parents, although there is a chance of having a random color/markings (which may still end up being the same as one of the parents). Bred with a donkey: cross-breeding a horse with a donkey creates a baby mule. Mules cannot breed. This unlocks the Artificial Selection achievement. This is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the baby horse when breeding two horses A and B.

Each time the kelp grows in height by one block, the newly generated top of the kelp plant increases its age by 1. When the top block of the kelp plant reaches an age of 25, it stops growing.

      "chunk_text": "Real electrical engineers and creative redstoners have designed circuits that calculate adder carries faster than this sequential method. Incidentally, adders that calculate carries one at a time in this fashion are called Ripple Carry adders. One of the simplest and most classic ways of solving the ripple carry problem is to use instant AND gates that use pistons. These adders are simple and fast, but are inconstant because they use pistons. When blocks are accidentally dropped, the entire circuit breaks. Pistons also have timing awkwardness that can be excruciatingly inconvenient when building an advanced circuit that relies heavily on timing. Whenever a carry is created, it is sent through the wire with the lever on it, and, instead of going through an AND gate, the piston retracts and the carry can move on to the next bit, which adds no carry propagation delay at all (until the signal strength runs out). This video shows a straightforward implementation of the logic. The design is large and spread out, so it's easy to see each individual part of the adder and the carry logic. Gates: XNOR (7), IMPLIES (4), NOT (4), OR (3), AND (3) Note! The least significant digit (\"ones\" digit) is on the left of the diagram so that the progression from half adder to the full adders can be seen more clearly. Reverse the diagram if you want a conventional left to right input. This adder takes two 4-bit numbers (A and B) and adds them together, producing a sum (S) bit for each bit added and a carry (C) for the whole sum. The sum bits are in the same order as the input bits, which on the diagram means that the leftmost S output is the least significant digit of the answer. This is just an example of a string of adders; adders can be strung in this way to add bigger numbers as well.

      "chunk_text": "Large magma cube: experience and 2-4 medium magma cubes Medium magma cube: experience and 2-4 small magma cubes Small magma cube: experience A magma cube seeks out any player or an iron golem within a spherical distance of 16 blocks. If it finds no enemy, it changes direction every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds) and jumps forward every 40 to 120 ticks (2 to 6 seconds). If it finds a target, the delay before jumping is as long (13 to 40 ticks), and the magma cube changes direction directly toward the target before jumping. Magma cubes cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning, and are not slowed down by lava. They can swim upward in lava and leap above its surface. Their jump height depends on their size (6 high for large). Their forward speed is twice that of most other mobs. They always make a distinct sound upon jumping up and landing, but no idle sounds. When a magma cube is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller magma cubes. Tiny magma cubes disappear when killed, like other mobs. They can swim in water and attempt to stay on the surface. Like slimes, magma cubes starts taking drowning damage if submerged in water for 15 seconds, splitting into smaller cubes if possible. Magma cubes take extra damage from powder snow, taking every two seconds, unlike for other mobs. Unlike most mobs, magma cubes have no pathfinding ability, meaning that they do not avoid falling off cliffs and cannot go around walls, even when chasing a player. This behavior is shared by slimes. When they are in lava, they hover and try to move to nearby land. Magma cubes attack by jumping and attempting to land on the player, and cause damage when touched anywhere. As their jump rate is random, magma cubes can be hard to fight. The health of a magma cube is its size squared; the attack strength is its size + 2, and the armor points are its size tripled. A magma cube jumps a distance of approximately its length times 1.5 and a height equivalent to its size in blocks. This means that a large magma cube jumps 4 blocks in height and moves significantly quicker than a small magma cube, which jumps 2 blocks in height; while a tiny magma cube moves slowly and jumps 1 block in height. Magma cubes continuously damage all players and iron golems they collide with (although damage immunity reduces the actual damage to 1 attack every half second), equivalent to about twice as often as other mobs. Despite other mobs only damaging targets they specifically attack. This means that a large magma cube deals of damage per second on normal difficulty.",

The biomes the trail ruins can be found in are the taiga, snowy taiga, old growth spruce taiga, old growth pine taiga, old growth birch forest, and the jungle. Trail ruins are the only structures where mud bricks, packed mud, and blocks of coal naturally generate. The trail ruins are structures that generate mostly underground with only the top of the tower above the ground. The ruins resemble small, ancient settlements. Each trail ruin has a main road made of cobblestone, stone, and stone bricks that connect multiple small buildings and a central tower made of stained terracotta and glazed terracotta, the tip of which is the only part of the structure that does not tend to generate underground. Adjacent to the tower generates two rooms and sometimes other small buildings and a decor made out of mud bricks and terracotta. Most of the structure is buried in gravel, dirt, and coarse dirt, as well as suspicious gravel, which may lead to the illusion that they are just a few misplaced blocks at first glance. Trail ruins are completely solid; they don't have interior rooms. Some blocks of suspicious gravel are generated floating. They fall and are destroyed if an adjacent block is updated.

Each structure piece (see the file structure list above for piece names) contains gravel and uses one of three processor lists to replace some of the gravel with other blocks, including suspicious gravel. All of the tower_top structure pieces and everything in the roads folder replaces two gravel with two common suspicious gravel. The rest replace nine gravel with six common suspicious gravel and three rare suspicious gravel. Additionally, all of the processor lists (except for the one used for the tower_top) first replace 20% of the gravel with dirt, then 10% of the remaining gravel with coarse dirt, followed by common suspicious gravel, and finally rare suspicious gravel (if applicable). This means a structure piece can generate less suspicious gravel than it should.

So when it comes to telegraphs, use of buttons should probably be avoided entirely. Although they are similar to buttons in their general impracticality, the player could potentially utilize the pressure plate's unique ability to be activated by mobs. Multiple pressure plates could be positioned at different points of a cave, all of which could be connected to the one-way distress telegraph mentioned earlier. If any mob (only harmful mobs would spawn in a deep cave) stepped on one, it would trigger the distress signal, and players elsewhere would be alerted and be able to take action. The receiver is the means of displaying a message sent from another telegraph room. They can be either redstone torches or redstone repeaters. The redstone torch is a primitive, but compact receiver, displaying each pulse as it arrives from the sender. It does not record, loop or display the entire message, and it cannot be interpreted easily without a solid understanding of the language being transmitted. It is most common in the one-way and classic telegraph systems, where simplicity and instantaneous viewing are most valuable. In addition, they are the only type of receiver that can be wall-mounted. The addition of redstone lamps makes display a lot simpler by eliminating the need for an inverter. Redstone repeaters, in their simplest form, can be used like the redstone torch receiver. However, they cannot be sent pulses as quickly or be mounted on walls, making them much more useful when placed in lines of two or more. This allows the receiving party to view a larger portion of the message as it is received, or, if the line is long enough, the entire message. The speed at which each pulse is displayed and lost can be adjusted by right-clicking each redstone repeater. This will increase or decrease the delay on each repeater before it passes on the signal. Such a system can be looped, so that the message is repeated to the receiving party indefinitely (note that looping a received message requires an erasing device and a message no longer than the receiver can display at one time). In addition to being able to loop, redstone repeaters have the advantage of being able to be \"locked\" to a state. Thus, if a message is sent in a pre-configured pulse, it's possible to have a pulse preceding the message to lock the message in place in the repeaters, removing the need for a loop, and adding the possibility of a \"timed eraser\" if executed correctly. To lock a repeater in its current state, a repeater must power the side of it, then locking the current state. Pistons can be used in multiple bit receivers so that they look like dots and dashes.",

Separate rails are laid adjacent, but at the next level, lower or higher rails can sometimes cause rail reorientation. A minecart travels straight through a T-junction when entering from the \"back of\" the curved rail. It follows the curve when entering from either of the other two legs. A minecart passes straight through a 4-way junction constructed to have no curved rail. When entering the 4-way from east or west a cart turns according to the south-east rule. At non-curve rail junctions, minecarts always travel downhill if they can, ignoring the south-east rule. A block placed above a rail line at the downhill end of a ramp prevents minecarts from traveling down the slope, but not up. For a minecart to move down a diagonal tunnel, there must be clearance sufficient for a player to walk through it.",

It also reduces direct impact damage from ghast fireballs and wither skulls, but not from their explosions.

Protection can be obtained from enchanting tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid, books obtained by fishing, monster room chests, librarian villagers, on armor dropped by various mobs, and non-village structure loot. Protection reduces the damage taken from all sources except for damage caused by hunger, a warden's sonic boom attack, the void or the command. This enchantment is capable of reducing damage from sources that normally ignore the user's armor value, such as falling or magical damage from status effects. The formula for damage reduction is for each armor piece, for a maximum damage reduction of 64% if all armor pieces are enchanted with Protection IV. Unlike the Blast Protection and Fire Protection enchantments, Protection offers no side effects outside of damage reduction. Damage reduction from Protection, Fire Protection, Feather Falling, Blast Protection, and Projectile Protection stacks up to an upper limit of 80% (see armor enchantments). However, it is impossible to reach this cap with the base Protection enchantment alone as it is impossible to obtain Protection V in survival mode. The protection enchantment is applied after the armor's damage reduction. If applied on wearable items that can't get the enchantment normally, such as a pair of elytra (using commands or an anvil in Creative mode), the enchantment works as usual. Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, and Projectile Protection are mutually exclusive. Attempting to combine these enchantments with an anvil deletes the enchantment in the upgrade slot and replaces it with the enchantment in the sacrifice slot. However, if commands are used to force two or more of these enchantments on the same item, the effects stack. But when the total of the EPF provided by the protection enchantments surpasses 20, the rest of these enchantments will no longer directly reduce the damage.",

The trading interface does not indicate the type of suspicious stew being sold, but each trade entry consistently yields the same type of stew, so the player can remember or make a note of the types offered by a given villager. , due to , all stews sold by farmers grant Night Vision for 5 seconds. Suspicious stew can be given with commands like ; , if the suspicious_stew_effect component is not specified, consuming the stew doesn't inflict any effect. , different types of suspicious stews can be given by specifying its metadata value. To eat suspicious stew, press and hold while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores hunger and 7.2 hunger saturation and gives a few seconds of a status effect that varies depending on which flower was used to craft it. The effect is not displayed in the tooltip, texture, etc., unless the tooltip is viewed from the Creative inventory (including saved hotbars), meaning that the player cannot know in advance what the effect is without knowing which flower was used. The bowl is emptied and returned to the player after the suspicious stew has been eaten, and can be re-used to craft more stews. Unlike most foods, suspicious stew can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is full. The Saturation effect effectively makes the blue orchid and dandelion stews a superfood: In those 7 or 6 ticks it can restore up to 7 or 6 hunger and 14 or 12 saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of at least hunger, and effectively maximizing saturation. This is the largest amount of hunger and saturation the player can get from a single food item. Regeneration can restore up to health, while Poison can inflict up to damage and Wither up to damage.

The chance of dropping a bow is increased by 1% per level of Looting, allowing up to an 11.5% chance of dropping. The chance of being enchanted depends on the difficulty level, but the random enchantment level (5–22) does not. Bows of skeleton horsemen are always enchanted at a random level from 5 to 23. The exact level depends on regional difficulty, as on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment. Enchanted bows are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt. See fishing for more details. When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random enchantments equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an enchanting table, including treasure enchantments like Mending. Bows can be drawn back by them. The player must have at least one arrow in their inventory or be in Creative mode in order to use a bow. When drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to critical charge causes it to visually bob up and down, and causes the fired arrow to have a trail of critical hit particles. Releasing the button shoots an arrow. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use. Arrows shot by bows are blocked by shields. While the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at sneaking speed, unless they are riding a horse, minecart or boat, or flying with elytra. When an arrow hits another player, the player that fired the arrow will hear a high-pitched \"ding\" sound to indicate the successful shot. Fired arrows are not affected by the Strength or Weakness effects. A few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. This includes: Endermen - even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows; Wither under half health, when it gains wither armor; Ender dragon, while sitting on top of the exit portal. A bow can be combined with another bow in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both. Bows can receive several different enchantments and have a base enchantability of 1.

Solid blocks are significantly different from liquid or gas blocks, through which entities can freely pass. Mobs require a solid top surface to spawn. Some mobs are able to spawn inside of the space occupied by another block, but only if their hitbox does not intersect the collision of any solid block. Players, mobs, and other entities can walk on top of solid blocks. Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles or water drip particles) also collide with solid blocks. If a solid block's collision box is a full cube that is solid on all sides, it is known as a full block. For example, stone, planks, and glass are full blocks, but stairs, fences, and chests are not. For most blocks, it's easy to tell whether they're full blocks or not, but some are not so obvious: Cauldrons and composters are not full blocks because their top face is not fully solid. Scaffolding is not a full block because although its interaction box occupies the full block, its collision box does not. Dirt path and farmland are not full blocks because they are slightly shorter than a full block. Mud and soul sand are not full blocks despite visually appearing to be because their collision boxes are shorter than their models, so entities standing on top \"sink into\" the blocks. Whether or not a block is a full block can influence some game mechanics.

It also serves as an armorer's job site block. A blast furnace can be picked up using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it does not drop itself. Blast furnaces drop their contents when broken. Blast furnaces can generate in any armorer house; these can be found in a village. Blast furnaces can also generate in trail ruins. Blast furnaces can be pushed by pistons. Blast furnaces are similar to furnaces, but can smelt only raw metal, ore blocks and tools/armor made of iron, gold, chainmail, or copper. Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to smokers, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron or gold nugget from their respective materials. Once an item and a fuel are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to lit and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace. Fuel is also used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items smelted per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by the output. Like normal furnaces, a hopper can be used to feed items into or collect items from a blast furnace. If a blast furnace has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to armorer and claim the blast furnace as their job site block. Blast furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, similar to normal furnaces. By default, the interface of a blast furnace is labeled \"Blast Furnace\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the command. , a blast furnace can be \"locked\" by setting its lock tag using the command.",

If the player is perfectly aligned with the bed when the spawn point is set, the right side of the bed takes priority. Interacting with the bed again will still update which side of the bed is chosen for respawning, even if the location of the spawn point itself does not change. Once a side is chosen, if the block immediately on the chosen side of the head of the bed is obstructed, the next block to be checked is chosen moving in a clockwise (right side) or counterclockwise (left side) direction around the bed. If all of the 10 blocks immediately adjacent to the bed are obstructed, the block above the head of the bed is checked, followed by the block above the foot of the bed. The player is always respawned facing the head of the bed, the same as for waking up. For a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again. Specifically, when interacting with it, the location of the head of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works.

In badlands erosions, gold ore can also be seen. Erosions in The Nether replace the floor with netherrack. Nether erosions can expose ore such as nether gold ore and nether quartz ore. Because erosions generate independent of the y-axis, if an erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang. Since erosions generate before features, chorus plants can take root in End erosions. The floor of End erosions is always end stone. When the game generates new chunks, the surface depth is calculated for every column inside the chunk based on the minecraft:surface noise. This value is an integer, and when it is less than or equal to 0, the top block from the surface is replaced with air. Note that because surface depth is calculated per-column, every surface in the column is removed; that is, an identical erosion appears above or below another one if there is an overhang. The surface depth rarely reaches these values, eliciting the rarity of erosions. After the hole is generated, the floor is replaced with a stone block of the respective dimension, and the hole is flooded with water if it is at or below sea level. Erosion generation occurs before carver creation in the terrain generation process, meaning that caves, features, and structures can disrupt or even completely conceal them.

Circuits can be used to transmit redstone signals, perform operations with logic gates, store data, shorten or lengthen redstone signals, make clocks, and more. A useful distinction can be made between a circuit performing operations on signals (generating, modifying, combining, etc.), and a mechanism using the environment (moving blocks, opening doors, changing the light level, producing sound, etc). Making this distinction allows us to talk about the various circuits separately, and let all players choose whichever circuits are useful for their purposes. The machines controlled by redstone circuits can range from simple devices such as automatic doors and light switches to complex devices such as elevators, automatic farms, or even in-game computers. However, this article provides only an overview of redstone circuits as above. These can be used to control simple mechanisms, or combined as parts of a larger build. Each circuit type on this page has links to its own page, which provides greater detail about them and give schematics for multiple variations of each. Before working with any but the most basic redstone circuits, an understanding of some basic concepts is required: \"power\", \"signal strength\", \"redstone ticks\", \"block updates\", etc. Some relevant articles are listed below: The Redstone mechanics article provides more information on these concepts. The Redstone components article adds a list and description of all blocks that interact with redstone power in general. The Mechanisms tutorial complements this article with an assortment of mechanism designs using circuits described here. The Redstone tips tutorial gives general advice about building redstone mechanisms Trigger blocks are blocks that can power outputs. Most circuits are described using Schematic diagrams; some of these require multiple images to show one or two layers per image. See the Help:Schematic page for details on how various blocks and components are represented. The wiki describes circuit size (the volume of the rectangular solid it occupies) with the notation of depth &times; width &times; height, including support/floor blocks, but not including inputs/outputs. Another method used for describing circuit size in the Minecraft community is to ignore non-redstone blocks simply used for support (for example, blocks under redstone dust or repeaters). However, this method is unable to distinguish between flat and 1-high circuits, as well as some other circuit differences. Sometimes it is convenient to compare circuits simply by the area of their footprint (e.g., 3×4 for a circuit three-block wide by four blocks long), or by a single dimension important in a particular context (e.g., length in a sequence of sub-circuits, height in a confined space, etc.).",

      "chunk_text": "A logic gate is a circuit that takes one or more inputs and produces a single output when some condition has been met. The strength of the input signal in these circuits usually doesn't matter. When an input or output supplies a redstone signal, it is usually just referred to as \"on\", and when there is no signal, it is referred to as \"off\". For example, an AND gate takes two redstone signals as input, and outputs a redstone signal only if both inputs are greater than 0. That is, an AND gate is on only when both inputs are on. In electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in Minecraft, all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results. A NOT gate (aka \"inverter\") is on if its input is off. The simplest NOT gate is an input signal with a redstone torch attached. An OR gate is on if any of its inputs are on. The simplest OR gate is to feed multiple input signals together into a single block or redstone wire. A NOR gate is on only if none of its inputs are on. The simplest NOR gate is to feed multiple input signals into a block with a redstone torch attached. An AND gate is on only if all of its inputs are on. The simplest AND gate is to add redstone torches in front of each input to a NOR gate. A NAND gate is on if any of its inputs are off. The simplest NAND gate is to remove the final redstone torch from an AND gate. An XOR gate is on if its inputs are different. An XNOR gate is on if its inputs are equal. An IMPLY gate is on unless the first input is on and the second input is off. A pulse circuit produces a redstone signal for a specified amount of time, changes the duration of an input signal, or reacts to signals of a particular duration. Other circuits or mechanisms may require pulses of a particular duration to operate properly, or can use pulse duration to convey information. A circuit that is stable in one output state and unstable in the other is known as a monostable circuit. Many pulse circuits are monostable because their OFF state is stable, but their ON state soon reverts to OFF. A pulse generator produces a pulse of a specific duration. A pulse limiter (aka pulse shortener) reduces the duration of pulses that are too long. A pulse extender (aka pulse sustainer, pulse lengthener) increases the duration of pulses that are too short. A pulse multiplier outputs multiple pulses for every input pulse (it multiplies the number of pulses). A pulse divider (aka pulse counter) outputs a signal only after a certain number of pulses have been detected through the input (the number of pulses is indicative of the number of loops). An edge detector reacts to either a redstone signal changing from OFF to ON (a \"rising edge\" detector), from ON to OFF (a \"falling edge\" detector), or switching between ON and OFF in either order (a \"dual edge\" detector).",

Therefore, the effective spawning space the slime needs is 3×2.1×3 blocks. , the space is centered in the northwest corner of a block. This means the effective spawning region is 2×2×2 blocks. The random distribution of slime sizes is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty. Slimes can spawn in swamps and mangrove swamps between the altitudes of Y=51 and Y=69 (inclusive) when the provided light level is 7 or less. They spawn most often on a full moon, and never on a new moon. More precisely, the game checks two factors: # If the light level is equal to or less than a random integer (from 0 to 7) # If the fraction of the moon that is bright is greater than a random number (from 0 to 1) If these conditions are met and the altitude is acceptable, there is a 50% chance of spawning a slime. The light level requirement for slime spawning in swamps is different from that of most hostile mobs, which spawn only at light level 0. This allows slimes in swamps to spawn in dimly-lit areas where most hostile mobs can't, allowing swamp-based slime farms to be built.",

Message displays are basically receivers are able to be viewed by the sender. Using these, one can view their message before it is sent to its destination. Either redstone torches or redstone repeaters can be used, usually corresponding to the type of receiver in the other telegraph room. When using a series of connected redstone repeaters, one can upgrade the display with a loop and eraser system. A display loop is a useful addition to both receivers and message displays. It connects the end of a redstone repeater display to its beginning, showing the message again and again until the eraser is activated. Erasing devices are an absolute necessity when creating a display loop. They end the looping message, and allow a new one to be shown before the two messages overlap pulses. A full loop and eraser system requires a customized NOR gate, through which the message is transferred and looped. An erasing device, though it can be as simple as an exposed, destroyable piece of the loop, is generally a lever wired to the custom NOR gate. Although they do take extra space, receiver loops should be built so that the input is on the opposite side of the NOR gate, so that no wires should have to cross paths. Also, remember, you can always use multiple levels of wire to avoid other parts of the telegraph. A NOR gate can be used in holding loops until you wish to send, delete or edit the message. You have to pull both levers back in order to activate it. Having both levers forward or one forward and one backwards will not activate the redstone torch. As indicated by the name, messages created in a one-way telegraph may only be sent in one direction, greatly limiting its capabilities. The schematic shown demonstrates a short configuration, complete with the required sender (1), inverter (2), wiring (3) and receiver (4). However, it is the only kind of telegraph with any real practicality in single player. If one were to have the sender in a mine, and the receiver in their house, they could effectively use it like a post-it stamp, leaving a message in their house to remind them, for example, that there was diamond in that mine. Expanding on this idea, they could have a series of redstone torches in their home indicating which of their mines had diamond or some other valuable element. Whenever another mine was discovered to have this element, they could simply flip a switch, and the mine's corresponding torch would activate in the house. An example of this is shown on the left. Another use would be as a simple distress signal in multiplayer, as it is always an issue of having to simultaneously type your call for help and run away from whatever is troubling you. The most basic system, the classic telegraph is quite easy to build, but not so easy to use.",

Surrounding it with up to fifteen bookshelves increases both its enchanting power and level requirement. An enchanting table requires a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and 1–3 lapis lazuli in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect. Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, while paying only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli. The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are \"maximum strength\" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. To increase the enchantment level, bookshelves should be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air, or a replaceable block such as grass, between them.",

They generally have a number of components which must be set in the right combination in order to activate something such as a door. Combination locks can be very useful in creating adventure maps. Note that if you are playing in survival multiplayer, other players will still be able to break into the mechanism and cause it to activate without knowing the password. A lever lock is one of the easiest redstone locks to create. Each lever doubles the number of combinations the lock has. The possibilities can be found using 2n, where n is the number of levers used. When constructing, you will probably first want to place the levers and put them into the desired positions. Next, you should place the redstone torches and repeaters. Torches go behind levers that are down and repeaters go behind levers that are up. When you are done, all of the torches and repeaters should be turned off. If not, double check any components that are turned on. Item frame combination locks are a step up in complexity from lever locks. Items in item frames can be rotated into 8 different positions. This rotation can be detected by a comparator which will output a signal strength from 1 to 8 depending on the position. Since each item frame has 8 possible states, the number of possible combinations can be found with 8n, where n is the number of item frames. The horizontal redstone paths on the floor decrease the signal emitted by the comparator down to a fixed strength of 1, and then feed it into an NOR gate that is true if the strength is either too small (B is not powered, i.e. false) or too large (A is powered, i.e. true). These gates are all ORed together so that the overall result is true if any item frame in the lock is misplaced; finally a torch (optional) inverts the result. If you want to make it extra tricky, it is also possible to detect an empty item frame by when a comparator doesn't output anything. Simply leave a repeater connected to the comparator and feeding into the vertical redstone wire on the right side; a filled item frame will give a signal strength of 15 out of the repeater and keep the door locked. Connect a series of buttons to the S-input of RS Latches. Feed the Q or Q (choose which one for each latch to set the combination) outputs of the RS Latches into a series of AND gates, and connect the final output to an iron door.",

Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders. When mobs are killed, they turn to smoke particles and drop items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within (a Euclidian distance) 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks away.

Players who use potions of Water Breathing will also be unaffected. Make a water elevator using soul sand bubble column, but without an exit at the top.

The old biomes were much smaller, sometimes smaller than a chunk, and less distinct. Biome generation was controlled in these versions by noise generated temperature and rainfall values, allowing for fully smooth transitions from biome to biome and preventing cold and warm biomes from generating next to one another. The specific biome was determined by where the combination of temperature and rainfall put it. (By modifying the game, it was also possible to create single biome worlds in these versions). Height variation was entirely independent of biome type, with biomes having no influence on the shape of terrain. This meant things like cliffs and mountains were able to generate up to nearly 128 on the y-axis in any biome. Tall grass was also much less present in pre-1.8 worlds (except in the \"Plains\" and \"Rainforest\" biomes). There were 13 biome types: 10 in the Overworld, 1 in the Nether, and 2 unused ones that are in the code but aren't encountered in normal play. These biomes were added in Java Edition Alpha 1.2.0, and underwent relatively few changes before their removal in Beta 1.8: birch and spruce trees were added in Beta 1.2 (which allowed for new chunks to have birch trees generate in forests and spruce to generate in taiga in place of oak trees), desert biome borders were rotated in Beta 1.3 due to a bug previously causing them to not line up, and tall grass and ferns were introduced in Beta 1.6. Grass and foliage colors were determined by an algorithm based on the temperature and humidity, rather than from the biomes directly. This means there can be a wide range of different grass and foliage colors for any one biome. Once the game gets the temperature and humidity values by pulling grass and foliage colors, it uses said values to grab colors from /misc/ or /misc/, and applies it to the uncolored grass or leaves. The same implementation also existed for water coloration with /misc/. However, this feature wasn't enabled in the code; Java Edition 1.13 would later implement biome-based water coloring, file (which had since been removed). This same terrain generator and set of biomes was ported almost directly to Xbox 360 Edition, with the only difference being that the terrain transitions to ocean near the edges of the world. Most Java Edition Beta seeds also work in Xbox 360 Edition prior to TU5, which rewrote world generation to match Beta 1.8.

They attack with a slow-charging laser beam, and inflict retaliatory damage when damaged by a melee attack. Guardians spawn naturally in ocean monuments. They require water, flowing or stationary, to spawn. guardians spawn less often in ocean open to the sky than they do in covered areas (such as inside or underneath the monument). Specifically, spawning fails 95% of the time if the spawning water block is below sea level (Y=63 by default), all blocks between the spawning water block and sea level are liquid or fully transparent, and the block at sea level has a view of the sky. They can spawn only if the spawning block and the block below the spawning block are both water. The block above the spawning block also cannot be solid and has to be transparent, air, or water. , guardians are structure spawns, spawning in water source blocks in 25 pre-determined spawning columns. Guardians usually do not (or possibly never) spawn near a player. Also, guardians seem not to spawn below solid blocks such as the prismarine blocks of the monument unless there are no water source blocks available above the solid blocks. This means that guardians don't spawn inside an ocean monument until most or all of the spawning column blocks above it are unavailable (i.e., no longer water source blocks). Guardians can spawn between Y=39–61 (inclusive, from the monument floor to one block above its highest point). To find the X and Z coordinates of the columns, start counting from the northwest corner of the monument. That is, standing on the furthest corner prismarine block with the smallest X and Z coordinates, let's say (X, 41, Z). The coordinates of each spawning spot are in a grid at X+2, X+13, X+29, X+45, and X+55, combined with Z+2, Z+13, Z+29, Z+45, and Z+55. For example, the bottom of the most northwest column is at (X+2, 39, Z+2) and the top block belonging to the southeast corner column is at (X+55, 61, Z+55). The guardians spawn at the northwest corner of a spawning column block, which can be helpful for some guardian farming mechanics such as causing them to spawn inside of a portal where they are immediately sent to the nether.

Minecarts with TNT can be retrieved by attacking them, and doing so drops them as an item. Critical hits are not applied to them, although the particles suggest otherwise. A minecart with TNT detonates after a delay on these conditions: It moves over a powered activator rail. It is destroyed while in motion (except by a player in Creative mode). It is destroyed by fire, lava, or an explosion. It is hit by a fire charge. The delay is for an activator rail, like the TNT block. For other causes there is a random delay between 0 and 1.95 seconds. It detonates instantly on these conditions: It hits the ground with a downward velocity of it falling more than three blocks, unless landing on any form of rail. It turns on a curved track too fast, with a solid block or entity located beside the track (in the previous movement direction). It is hit by a flaming projectile. It is pressed into a block or entity and has velocity. Upon detonation it acts as normal TNT, exploding and damaging nearby blocks, players, and entities. Upon detonation after activating on activator rail, it does not destroy its rails and the blocks the rail is on, however other nearby minecarts can. More than one minecart can be placed on the same rail block, allowing many of them to fit into a single block. They explode when touched, dealing large amounts of damage. The explosion has a base power of 4, the same as regular TNT, but the game also adds a random bonus value up to 1.5 times velocity, but no higher than 7.5. This means that with a speed of 5 or higher the power is a random value between 4 and 11.5. When triggered by an activator rail or by damage, the bonus value is calculated using the horizontal velocity of the minecart. When hit by a flaming arrow the velocity of the arrow is used instead.

While worn as torso armor, they allow for gliding by pressing while midair. Firework rockets can be as propulsion while gliding, allowing for true flight. Elytra are found only in end cities in item frames in the treasure room of the end ship. A shulker guards the elytra and the ship's two loot chests. Elytra are equipped in the chestplate slot, either by placing the item directly in the slot, by pressing while held in hand, or by firing a point-blank dispenser at a target. They are gray in color by default, but they adopt the design of any cape the player is wearing. They maintain their in-world texture design even when they're broken or enchanted. To fly, the player must press the key while in mid-air (e.g. while jumping or falling), and the elytra spread apart like a beetle's wings. The player can aim their view around to turn or adjust their pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed. Firework rockets can be to increase speed. Additionally, speed is quickly lost from sharp changes in direction. The player can take fall damage while flying unless they land at a shallow angle or a low enough speed. The critical, damaging angle is about 50°. Additionally, colliding with a vertical surface while gliding too fast causes damage to the player and their armor. When a player dies in this way, they receive the death message \" experienced kinetic energy\". Note that colliding with a horizontal surface does not cause this type of damage, so the player takes no damage when flying into a ceiling. The amount of damage caused by a collision is determined by the formula: \\text{damage} = 10\\times(\\text{change in horizontal velocity}) - 3 A safe and simple cruise with the highest travel distance can be achieved by aiming directly at the horizon while at the glide's altitude limit.

To place a trapdoor, a trapdoor item while pointing at the block it should be attached to. Once it is placed, the attachment block can be removed without breaking the trapdoor. When placed, a trapdoor either occupies the top or bottom part of a block, depending on where the player placed the trapdoor. If a trapdoor is placed on the top part of a block, it opens downward. If placed on the bottom part of a block, it opens upward. A trapdoor's \"hinge\" is located on the block attached to it. Trapdoors can act as a solid block when in the closed position, and thus certain items can be placed above or below it (depending on whether the closed trapdoor occupies the top half or bottom half of a block). When trapdoors are opened, they act like a non-solid block resulting as a non-placeable area.

The random selector (right) depends on the random flight of an item from a dropper. The input (button) in this random selector turns off the torch, deactivating the piston. It also powers a redstone dust directed into the block, powering the repeater and activating the dropper. The piston then reactivates to push the stuck item (if any). A hopper collects the item and puts it back into the dropper, activating a comparator. NOTE: The dropper must be facing up. If facing down, the item glitches out of the machine. Earliest Known Publication: 24 September 2014 An old kind of random selector is the \"chicken randomizer\", which uses a chicken walking on multiple pressure plates in a containment chamber. For this and other improved randomizers, view the randomizers tutorial. Another way to construct a random selector is to feed the output of a digital randomizer into a demuxer. You can create a 1-bit digital randomizer from an analog 2-RNG by discarding one of the outputs, and then combine N of them for an N-bit digital randomizer. A thyristor is a bit like a D flip-flop but has a different functionality. It has two inputs: the \"gate\" line G and the \"anode\" line A, and has one output: the \"cathode\" line K. When triggered by G, the circuit sets its output K to A if A is high, then holds that output state until A goes low. Otherwise K stays low. Design A is the simplest form of the circuit. The hopper is initially empty so K stays low regardless of whether A is high or low. When G goes high, the item in the dropper moves to the hopper so K goes high as well. The hopper is suspended by A so as long as A is high, the item doesn't go back to the dropper so K is kept high. But there is a downside to this design. When triggered by G while A is low, a 1 tick on-pulse is emitted from K. Design B is an improved form at the cost of complexity / size / delay. There is an AND gate between G and A so the gate input gets completely discarded when A is low. Earliest Known Publication: 28 March 2016 This is an automatic item disposer with a start button. Put items in the chest, then push the button behind it. All the items in the chest are thrown into lava via clocked dropper below the chest.

There are three variants of the oak tree: small regular oaks, tall and branching fancy oaks, and swamp oaks. Oaks come in several variants with different properties: Small regular oaks are the most common. The leaves are arranged the same as the birch leaf arrangement. Fancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding logs surrounded by leaves. The sapling requires 4&ndash;14 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides. A fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6. Branches and outgrowths, however, require 8 blocks of open space directly above the sapling. An oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a \"brace\" of non-solid blocks (e.g. glass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground. A rare variant is colloquially known as a \"balloon\" oak. This is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible.

A player in flight who drops to 0 speed quickly accelerates back up to at least this minimum. The player can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they typically do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed and slows an aircraft; Minecraft also mimics this. Sharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player should aim to glide just above the target then immediately reverse direction right over the target, making adjustments as necessary. With the right technique, it is actually possible to glide as far, as high, and for as long as the player wants, until the elytra breaks. First, start from 50 blocks above the ground, though around 80 blocks up is ideal. Fly down with a pitch between 32-33° to build up speed until you lose about 60-70 blocks of altitude. Then, immediately pitch up to about -50°, and slowly pitch down by +0.5° per tick (+10° per second) until reaching 32 degrees again, and repeat. If done correctly, the player can gain 3 blocks of altitude per cycle, though it may be possible to gain up to 10 blocks of altitude per cycle on average. The lowest rate of altitude loss without changing your pitch is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12° or 15°). To get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude) without changing pitch, the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon (0°). This ratio is about 10.06 blocks travelled horizontally per 1 block of starting altitude on average. This does not include the time and altitude that it takes to build up speed. Slow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling). The net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking).",

Attempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn. However, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved. If the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning. It is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way. Falling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength – the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity. The player also takes less fall damage when bouncing on a bed. The player's fall distance is set to 50% of the actual distance fallen, which usually results in the player taking less than half of the normal fall damage. Baby villagers bounce on beds during the day. If the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes. A player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up. Villagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.

This way, if source and destination portals are of the same shape, have the same orientation, and no other portals are interfering with the linking, one can safely assume that entities can travel through them as if the portal frames were physically placed behind each other. If no portals exist in the search region, the game creates a new one by looking for the closest suitable location to place a portal, within 16 blocks horizontally (but any distance vertically) of the incoming entity's destination coordinates. A valid location is 3×4 buildable blocks with air 4 high above all 12 blocks, with the long axis matching the long axis of the source portal. The closest valid position in the 3D distance is always picked. Again note that the incoming entity can be almost any entity except withers and the ender dragon or only be a player . This means that if a portal constructed in the Nether exceeds 18 blocks wide, each end will connect to two separate overworld portals. If the first check for valid locations fails entirely, the check is redone looking for a 1×4 expanse of buildable blocks with air 4 high above each. If that fails, too, a portal is forced at the target coordinates, but with Y constrained to be between 70 and 10 less than the world height (i.e. 118 for the Nether or 310 for the Overworld). When a portal is forced in this way, a 2×3 platform of obsidian with air 3 high above is created at the target location, overwriting whatever might be there. This provides air space underground or a small platform if floating. , these obsidian blocks are flanked by 4 more blocks of netherrack on each side, which is the only renewable source of netherrack. Once coordinates are chosen, a portal (always 4×5 and including the corners) including portal blocks is constructed at the target coordinates, replacing anything in the way. If a portal is forced into water or lava, the liquid immediately flows into the generated air blocks, leaving the player with no airspace. However, a glitch can prevent this water from flowing into the portal: if the liquid would flow both vertically and horizontally into the air pocket, it instead flows only vertically, so the blocks on the platform's outer corners never become water source blocks.",

A one-hot encoding consists of multiple digital lines run in parallel, where a value is represented by which line is on (for example, the number 5 might be represented by having only the fifth line on, and all other lines off). A common alternative to one-hot encoding is one-cold encoding, where a number is represented by which line is off instead of which line is on. While a strict one-hot encoding would always have precisely one line hot, a useful alternative is to eliminate the \"0\" line and represent the number 0 with no lines hot. One-hot and one-cold encoding are rarely used for transmitting values over distance, but may be used for inputs (e.g., which button is pressed) or outputs (e.g., which dispenser is activated), with conversion to or from a more efficient transmission encoding in between. They are also used as a transitional encoding — for example, it is relatively complicated to decode from analog to binary directly, but relatively simple to first decode from analog to one-cold, then encode from one-cold to binary. A unary encoding consists of multiple digital lines run in parallel, where a value is represented by the number of lines on (for example, the number 5 might be represented by having 5 of 16 lines powered). A unary encoding might use a convention that lines must be powered starting from one side (allowing values to be determined from the transition from powered lines to unpowered lines) or that they can be powered in any combination (requiring logic circuits or calculations to determine the represented value). Unary encoding is rarely used for transmitting values over distance, but may be used for inputs (e.g., the number of players standing on pressure plates) or outputs (e.g., the number of doors opened along a passageway).

The work in progress computer which we will be making in the tutorial. 8 bits, 16 bytes of RAM. I/O is a seven-segment display (for hex and decimal) and a control panel which we will make. The MASIC computer aims to be a one-size-fits-all computer and does not specialize in one task, so it is fully programmable by reading its own memory (explained in Section 2: instruction sets). The simple I/O is great for multipurpose use and the memory is sufficiently sized. It runs at quite a fast speed (because of its small size). Decoders convert binary figures into decimals. For example, looking at the 8-bit decoder, 00 turns on the first lamp which stands for 0. 01 turns on the second lamp which is 1. 10 turns on the third which is 2. 11 turns on the last one which is 3. This is the design for the address decoder we are going to build. Above is a simple 2-bit state, so it has two inputs (left and right) through the repeaters. The output is the redstone line above which will turn OFF when the state is met. The state is whether the redstone input will turn OFF the redstone line above; if so, the state is the redstone inputs. In the above case, the left must be turned OFF (0) and the right (blue) must be turned ON (1) to yield an OFF on the top redstone line. So it expects a state of OFF ON (aka 01 for binary). They are colored blue for bits which should be ON (1) for it to stop powering the top redstone line. Once every bit stops powering the redstone line, it then turns off. These are basically either one or two NOT gates feeding into a OR gate and then NOT the output. Above is an 8-bit state, it expects 8 inputs in exactly the order 0000 1101. So that state it expects is 0000 1101. So the redstone torches power the inputs, and so we see the redstone line on the top turns OFF (only when exactly three redstone torches are placed in that exact order of 0000 1101). Now if we put multiple of these together, we can count up in binary with the blue bits to get all 255 states of 8 bits. The one below is 8 bits, and has four state expectations. See the right images to see it in action. Now each green output can be a memory cell, and if we continue counting in binary, it will reach 255. The input is 0000 0011 (see the redstone torches for input) and where the blue bits match the current state, the green output is ON. 0000 0000&mdash;first signal out (on the images on the right) 0000 0001&mdash;second signal out 0000 0010&mdash;third signal out 0000 0011&mdash;fourth signal out So now we keep counting up in binary to get up to 0000 1111 and stop there; we should now have 24 (16) state expectors.

This prevents players and mobs from jumping over them, while using only one actual block space. A wall occupies the center space of blocks. A wall block connects to side and top blocks in three ways: A wall block automatically connects to any horizontally adjacent connectable block surface, iron bars or glass pane. Although they connect horizontally to iron bars and glass panes, they do not connect horizontally to fences (fence gates can be connected though). The top of a connect-to-side part rises slightly to support any block immediately above if it covers the 2-pixel-wide area on the wall top from the four pixels at the center to the connected side. A wall block always has a center post connecting to the top if covered by a banner, a pressure plate, a ground torch, soul torch or redstone torch, a sign, tripwire, another wall block with a center post, or any block covering the four pixels at the center on its top without making the wall block raise its top on any two opposite sides. A wall block has a center post even if not covered by the blocks mentioned above, unless connecting to only two opposite sides or all four sides. Without center posts, walls connect to other walls to create a large, flat wall. Wall blocks are more efficient at fencing off mobs than a two-block high wall of regular blocks, costing half as many blocks, and being more space-efficient as well. However, a skeleton might shoot over the wall, a creeper could explode if a player is standing near the wall, a spider could still climb over the wall, and a camel can walk over the wall. Unlike fences, if two walls are placed one block apart diagonally, the player cannot walk between them. Walls can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds. Walls can be used to give block updates (post placement updates ) to other walls under it when connected to another block; the walls under the connected wall will change the block state that controls the center post to the same state as the wall above if the wall above makes the wall below raise its top on any two opposite sides, which can be detected by an observer.

Redstone staircases can transmit signals both upward and downward but can take up much space and require repeaters every 15 blocks.

Because it takes each torch a little time to change state, a torch tower can introduce some delay into a circuit, but no repeaters are necessary. However, every torch inverts the redstone signal (i.e. changes it from powered to unpowered), so having an even number of torches is required. An observer can power a block of a redstone circuit above or below it, allowing vertical transmission both upward and downward. Placing blocks that can be activated, such as redstone dust, note blocks or doors, both above and below it creates a state change to the block above when the observer is looking downward or to the block below when the observer is looking upward.

The insides of Far Lands were long dark tunnels, featuring sharp edges and extreme landscapes. Mobs might spawn in there, with monsters being the most common. The top and corners of the Far Lands are mostly flat, filled with trees and occasionally villages. Reaching further at 1,004,065,811 blocks, the noise generators would break down again and produce even more stretched terrain, these often being called the \"Farther Lands\". The Far Lands were fixed later on Beta 1.8 Pre-release, and an intentional world border was placed more than twice as far as the former hard boundary on Java Edition 1.8, but they still retain a legacy as one of the franchise's most famous glitches, even being referenced in other official games such as Minecraft: Story Mode and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The Far Lands technically still exist in the game, however, they are far beyond the world border. The Far Lands comprise a very, very wide array of terrain generation bugs. The effects vary depending on which noise generator breaks (for traditional Far Lands, \"low noise\" and \"high noise\" are jointly responsible), as well as the player's distance on each axis (the \"Edge Far Lands\" refer to when noise breaks on only one axis, the \"Corner Far Lands\" on two, and the \"Vertex Far Lands\" on three). Other noise generators are capable of breaking down. Selector noise, a noise generator which determines whether low noise or high noise is used at a given position in the world, breaks down 80 times further than low and high noise by default, giving rise to what is known as the \"Farther Lands\". A full list of noise generators known to break down and give rise to their own unique effects is as follows. Note that it assumes that the X and Z axes are identical, and ignores the Y axis; in many cases, the Y axis has a different value from the X and Z axes, whereas in other cases the noise generator is entirely 2D. Time-wise, the walking (not sprinting) speed is 4.3 blocks per second. Walking for 6 hours per day is equal to 21,600 seconds, giving a travelled distance of 92,880 blocks every day. Walking to the 12.5M Far Lands would take just under 136 days at this pace. Furthermore, three people, Xelanater, qSav, and Wenzo have reached the Nether Far Lands legitimately.",

The schematic of a simple two-way telegraph is shown on the right. 1 and 2 are small control rooms, and A and B are inverters. Note that the area in between the two inverters can be elongated, with appropriately spaced redstone repeaters. The classic telegraph allows for a speedy construction and a space as small as 1×2×2 for each control room. In addition, due to its limited size and capability, it requires little to no knowledge of logic gates or circuitry, making it ideal for beginners or when you're low on redstone. The downside is that while you may be new to Minecraft, you have to be remarkably fluent in whatever language you decide to send the telegram in. This goes for the receiving party as well. In fact, they must begin reading the message the instant you begin sending it, or risk losing its meaning entirely. This quickly becomes problematic, especially when the server is lagging. Despite this, players use it anyway, often because they enjoy the great similarity it holds to real telegraphs. So while the classic telegraph is compact, simple, and highly realistic, it may be worthwhile to look into a more advanced system. Although the classification spans most telegraph types, the multi-directional telegraph is quite unique in its general design, and can be challenging to configure. This is mainly due to the amount of wiring required, and, in turn, the amount of space needed. For instance, a three direction telegraph requires a minimum of six separate lengths of wire, and that's just to create a classic one-torch receiver system, with no additional capabilities. While this is less of a problem over short distances, acquiring the massive quantities of redstone needed for such a project can be problematic, and it is good practice to make a rough estimate of how much you'll need before beginning its construction. This is a really simple Morse code receiver and sender. The redstone lamp aligned near the lever shows what the sending is, and the lamp in the wall on layer 1 is the receiver. The signs are to show which telegraph room is receiving the message. Build a mirror of the structure to complete a multi-directional Morse telegraph sender and receiver room. The redstone on the floor is the sender and the line on the slab is the receiver. Structure starts above ground Slabs are on upper section Levers hooked onto top wall This device allows you to transmit different signals without any modification to the transmission line (it can remain a combination of redstone wires and repeaters). In this system, different frequencies represent different signals. To build this circuit, you should build a transmitter — a simple oscillator — and attach it to the transmission line with a repeater. At the other end of the line, build another oscillator with the same delay.",

'I' represents the input, 'S' represents the selectors and 'f' the outputs. The two selector wires, holding a two digit binary number (2 wires = 2 digits), are passed to a decoder. If the input wire is on, then the output wire of the demultiplexer corresponding to the output of the decoder turns on. For example, if the input is on and the binary number 10b is passed onto the select wires (S0=on,S1=off. Start counting at zero!), then the decoder turns on the third wire (10 in binary is two, but because we start count at zero it becomes the third). An AND operation is performed between the input wire of the demultiplexer and each of the outputs of the decoder. As stated earlier, because both the input wire and only the 3rd output of the decoder is on, only the third output of the whole demultiplexer is on.

Keep in mind that the unloader receives two distinct output items (shulker boxes and other items being sucked out of them), meaning one should build a system that sorts that output. The player might not find unloaders as useful, but they still have practical purposes. If the player's base has a storage system, then the player can come back from a long journey and dump an inventory-full of shulker boxes with various valuables into a chest. A system could then unload the shulker boxes and sort out the contents. In an automatic tree farm, several shulker boxes with bone meal can be unloaded gradually to be used. In a printer, especially 3D, it is easiest to program using shulker boxes to “write” the instructions and a shulker box unloader to “read” the instructions. Minecarts with hoppers have an unique property - they can take 20 items away from container blocks every second, allowing one to create exceedingly fast shulker box unloaders, while still preserving shulker boxes. Be careful about the performance impact as minecarts with hoppers may cause a lot of lag, as they constantly check for various things every tick. There are also unloaders that burn shulker box items instead, causing them to instantly spit out its contents, which then get sorted by the system, however, in exchange of performance impact, this doesn't preserve shulker boxes, but with the existence of shulker farms, this method is more convenient. Hoppers are laggy redstone components and locking them when the unloader is idle can benefit the performance. This is because hoppers, similarly to minecarts with hoppers, check for many things every tick. If you end up with chests full of random shulker boxes and you can't easily find the ones you need, you might want to start using a machine that uses a shulker box search engine. With these machines, you can store your shulker boxes without worrying about sorting them or even the items within them. The machine uses a filter to look for a specific item in the shulker boxes you have stored in your system until it finds a shulker box that contains the item you are looking for. Although hard to find, there are some designs that can load and unload with the same system, just pushing a few buttons to switch between the two \"modes.\" Another way redstone can aid shulker box storage is by making use of a so-called \"Search Engine\".",

The fox sits for a short time, then hops back up. Foxes sit down even when attached to a lead or in a boat. Foxes that have not been bred by the player always sit while in the Nether, even while attached to a lead. If any item is on the ground near a fox, it travels to the item and picks it up, and the item appears in the fox's mouth. However, usually a fox chooses to attack a mob over picking up an item. This behavior is not limited to food and animal products; a fox can pick up any item that the player can pick up. However, they prefer to pick up food items, and if they have already picked up non-food items, they drop the non-food items to pick up food instead. A fox can also swap a food item it is holding for a different food item. A fox eats any food item it picks up (besides cake) after 30 seconds and the fox is affected by any side effects from the food, such as poison or teleportation. For example, if a fox eats an enchanted golden apple, it obtains the Absorption, Resistance, Fire Resistance and Regeneration. If a fox eats any type of soup or stew, an empty bowl is dropped. If a fox eats a chorus fruit, it teleports accordingly. If there is a stage 3 or 4 sweet berry bush within a 16 block radius of a fox, it sprints toward the bush and eats the sweet berries, dropping the item it was holding. However, if the fox stands on a solid block directly above the sweet berry bush and is already holding an item, the fox will harvest the sweet berries, making them drop, but will not eat them nor drop the item it was holding. Foxes are not damaged or slowed by sweet berry bushes. Although visually holding items in its mouth, they are functionally being held in its main hand; therefore, the fox is affected by any effects of a given held item. A sword increases its damage, and a totem of undying saves it from death, for instance. If a fox picks up a weapon or an item with enchantments, such as Looting and Fire Aspect, these items affect the fox's attack as if the fox is wielding the weapon in its main hand, although the item retains its durability when used by the fox.",

It drops nothing when broken using anything else, or if lava flows over it. Cobwebs generate naturally in mineshafts, stronghold libraries, igloo basements, abandoned villages, woodland mansion spider spawner rooms, and trial chambers around specific trial spawners. When an entity with the Weaving effect dies, 2-3 cobwebs can generate in a 3×3×3 cube centered on the entity's location of death. The cobwebs can generate only on top of blocks with a full top face, meaning that cobwebs cannot generate on top of other cobwebs. When the game rule is set to , entities excluding the player do not generate cobwebs upon death. Mobs can spawn inside of cobwebs. Cobwebs also diffuse sky light. Undead mobs do not catch fire from sunlight if they are under a cobweb or their head is inside a cobweb. Blocks can be placed on cobwebs. Paintings and signs can be placed on their sides, or on top in the case of signs. Despite being slowed down by them, mobs do not try to pathfind around cobwebs, which can be exploited to construct clever mob traps. Cobwebs can be used as a delaying mechanism in a redstone circuit, for example, to delay an item falling on a pressure plate or into a hopper. They can also be used to cancel random momentum of an item thrown from a dispenser or dropper by placing them directly on their face. All mobs except for spiders, cave spiders, shulkers and vexes experience slow movement through a cobweb and, if affected by gravity, fall approximately 0.078 blocks/second while within it, taking nearly 13 seconds to fall 1 full block.",

Feather Falling IV can also be obtained by combining two Feather Falling III enchantments on an anvil, trading with villagers, fishing, and in the following structure loot chests: desert pyramids, strongholds, ocean ruins, ancient cities, mansions, pillager outposts, mineshafts, monster rooms, jungle pyramids, and from vaults in trial chambers. Feather Falling reduces all forms of fall damage taken, even though fall damage normally ignores armor. This is not limited to falling from a great height either; Feather Falling reduces the damage taken from thrown ender pearls or from riding a mob that takes significant fall damage. Feather Falling reduces damage taken from crashing into the ground with an elytra, but it does not reduce damage taken from crashing into a wall.

Any further damage reduction that would normally occur is instead ignored. Feather Falling IV cannot reach this cap alone, as it reduces fall damage by only 48%. However, if combined with multiple Protection enchantments, the damage cap can be reached since Protection also reduces fall damage. To reach this cap using only Feather Falling, level VII would be required which is possible only with the use of commands.

A redstone repeater can \"repeat\" a redstone signal, boosting it back up to power level 15. Redstone signals have a maximum power level of 15 and that level drops by 1 for every block of redstone dust the signal travels through. If a signal must travel through more than 15 blocks of redstone dust, a redstone repeater can be used to boost the signal back up to full strength. An extra two blocks of distance can be achieved by placing conductive blocks before and after the repeater. While redstone repeaters can allow signals to travel great distances, each always adds some delay to the transmission since the minimum amount of delay is . When initially placed, a redstone repeater has a delay of . A repeater's delay can be modified by using the control. Each use increases the repeater's delay by two ticks, to a maximum of eight, then reverting back to two ticks. Longer delays can be made with multiple repeaters – for example, a repeater set to '8' and another to '2' provides a half-second delay (8 &times; 0.05s + 2 &times; 0.05s = 0.5s). A repeater set to a delay of four to eight ticks increases the length of any shorter on-pulse to match the length of the repeater's delay, and suppresses any shorter off-pulse. For example, a repeater set to a 4-tick delay changes a 1-tick, 2-tick, or 3-tick on-pulse into a 4-tick on-pulse, and does not allow through any off-pulse shorter than 4 ticks. Although a repeater cannot be set to have a delay of zero, , instant repeater circuits are possible (circuits that repeat a signal with no delay). A redstone repeater acts as a diode – it allows redstone signals through in one direction (unlike redstone dust or conductive blocks that can transmit redstone signals in any direction). A diode can be used to protect a redstone circuit from redstone signals feeding back into the circuit from its output, or can be used to isolate one part of a circuit from another. A redstone repeater can be \"locked\" by another powered redstone repeater facing its side. When locked, the repeater does not change its output (whether powered or unpowered), no matter what the input does. When the side repeater turns back off, the repeater returns to its normal behavior. A repeater can also be locked by a powered redstone comparator facing its side. This offers additional possibilities for locking signals because a comparator's output can be affected from 3 sides as well as by containers. If a repeater is locked again too quickly after unlocking (e.g. the lock is controlled by a fast clock circuit), or the lock and the input are changed only on the same tick (e.g.",

Creaking hearts do not function outside the simulation distance of players. Valid locations for creakings to spawn at follow these criteria: The block below must have a solid top surface.

Creakings ignore solid blocks within its hitbox that are 2+ blocks above the ground while spawning. Creaking hearts never spawn creakings in the Nether nor the End. Breaking the heart kills its linked creaking and attributes the kill to the player who broke it, adding the kill to their statistics and triggering the Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted advancements.

The site block may need to be broken or interacted by a piston before the villager unclaims it. Villagers can store memories about players in the form of gossip. These get spread to other villagers whenever they talk with each other. Each piece of gossip is one of five types, and it stores a value as well as a target. Gossips generate and increase in value as a result of various player actions. The target is the player who caused the gossip. Together the gossip values determine a player's reputation with villagers, which influences trading prices and the hostility of naturally spawned iron golems. Trading with or curing a villager increases the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager only. When a villager is attacked or killed, however, it instead generates the major negative gossip in every other villager with whom it has eye-to-eye line of sight inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions. When a piece of gossip is shared, it is received at a lower value than the sharer has it. Gossips also decay a certain amount (see Decay column) every 20 minutes. Since major positive gossip has a share penalty >= its max value and a decay of 0, it cannot be shared and never decays. A player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by its respective multiplier and adding the results together. For example, if a player has recently cured a villager for the first time but has also attacked the villager twice, the player's reputation with that villager would be 5×20 + 25 - 50 = 75. After 40 minutes, the gossips decay twice, making the player's reputation 5×20 + 23 - 10 = 113. The prices of a villager's trades all are reduced by reputation times the price multiplier rounded down, meaning that a positive reputation lowers prices but a negative reputation increases them. The price multiplier is either 0.05 or 0.2 depending on the item, see trading. Prices can not be lower than 1 or higher than the item's stack size. The exact function to calculate the price affected by the gossips is y = x - floor((5a + b + c - d - 5e) × p), Where y is the final price, x is the base price, a is the value of major_positive, b is the value of minor_positive, c is the value of trading, d is the value of minor_negative, e is the value of major_negative, and p is the value of PriceMultiplier. An iron golem that was not built by a player becomes hostile toward all players whose reputation with any nearby villager is -100 or lower.",

However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero. Enchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 level could be spent to enchant a book or a different tool to refresh the list. The possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1–30).

This is checked before each of the four spawn attempts. A monster spawner performs a relaxed version of the ordinary spawning check: the general solid block requirement is removed, but the volume (hitbox of the mob) is kept along with some other checks according to mob specifics. As a result, for some types of mobs to spawn in the outer planes of the spawning volume, some planes outside the volume may also need to be free of solid blocks to conform with the mobs' height, width, or other rules governing their individual spawn volumes. Examples: For mobs that are two or more blocks tall such as zombies, skeletons, or blazes to spawn in the top y-layer, the layer above must contain only a transparent block such as air, glass, leaves, etc. , a turtle monster spawner can spawn turtles only on sand blocks less than 4 blocks above sea level (typically at Y=62). no biome/light/height conditions apply for turtles in monster spawners. , some animals require light level 7+, e.g. chicken, sheep, cow, rabbit.

Occasionally, they may croak and inflate their vocal sac. Frogs follow any player holding a slimeball within 6 blocks of them. Feeding two frogs a slimeball causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the frogs to become pregnant, similar to turtles. The pregnant frog then searches for a water block with at least one adjacent water block (flowing or source) with air above to lay their eggs, known as frogspawn. This spawn later hatches into several tadpoles, which subsequently grow into frogs. Unlike all other mobs with baby variants, the tadpole is treated by the game as a completely different mob from the frog. Furthermore, the biome in which the tadpoles grow into frogs determines their variant type, regardless of their parental variant type, a unique characteristic specific to frogs. Frogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth and eat them, whereupon the mob instantly despawns without a death animation.

Skins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (white), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, cream fur, and salt and pepper fur. The biome determines the skin used: Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur. Rabbits in deserts have 100% cream fur. Rabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt fur, and 10% black fur. Rabbits with specific skins can be spawned using or . While it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, except for RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny. There are two special variants of rabbits: The killer bunny is an unused hostile variant of the rabbit exclusive to that is hostile toward players and wolves. It has pure white fur and horizontal red eyes, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes. It can be spawned only by using the command. It appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\". If the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a spider. Once it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing damage on Normal difficulty. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player. If it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any wolves, including tamed wolves. On peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player. The killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature. Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural white splotched rabbit. Other than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like a normal rabbit. When Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming. If the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves. Like the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.

      "chunk_text": "Monoliths were glitched areas of terrain that happened in the later versions of Infdev and early Alpha stages of the game. These monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly invert, with natural terrain generation replacing the air/water up to the height limit and vice versa. Monoliths would generate in seemingly random locations throughout the world. They tended to generate around flattish terrain. They were caused by an error in the Perlin noise generator. Specifically, the hilliness of the terrain (the \"terrain scale\") was controlled by a noise map. The reciprocal of the value of this noise was then used as the intensity of a gradient applied to the terrain. Because the reciprocal is used, flatter terrain is caused by lower values (where the terrain bias gradient drops off faster), and hillier terrain is caused by higher values. Because the reciprocals of small negative numbers are very large negative numbers, the terrain abruptly changes when zero is crossed, causing the gradient to bias higher elevations toward being ground, and lower elevations toward being air. Thus, when terrain scale becomes negative, terrain generates upside-down, generating monoliths. This was possible in early Alpha because the noise map that determined terrain scale could return a negative value. (This may be the same 2d noise map used in Classic, where adding multiple octaves together could result in unpredictably high or low values.) The monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly generate up to the height limit, with natural grass block and ore generation. They could theoretically generate arbitrarily tall, being stopped only by the height limit, which - at this point in the game's development - was 128 blocks. The area below the monoliths was completely hollow, except for water generating at sea level and a layer of bedrock at the bottom, making the normal terrain seem like inverse monoliths.

The biome generates similar to regular badlands, with red, orange, yellow, white, light gray, brown, and regular terracotta forming the landscape. Lower grounds are mostly made of red sand and red sandstone, with brown terracotta underneath. Dead bushes grow on terracotta and red sand, while cacti along with occasional cactus flowers only appear on red sand. Like all badlands biomes, gold ore generates more frequently and closer to the surface, and mineshafts made out of dark oak can also be found, often exposed to air. Terrain underwater in lakes is coated with a layer of orange terracotta, with shallow areas occasionally featuring white terracotta too. Deeper bodies of water may contain scattered gravel. Rainfall never occurs in eroded badlands, as the biome is arid, and lightning never strikes here. Exception to both rules are rivers that cut through eroded badlands, which still experience both. Eroded badlands feature unique formations of terracotta hoodoos, narrow spires that rise up from the red sand floor of the biome's drainage basins. Thanks to these hoodoos, eroded badlands provide a more accessible source of terracotta, allowing players to gather it without digging into the terrain. The hoodoos only generate at lower elevations. At higher elevations, the biome is indistinct from the regular badlands. The biome is intended to resemble the famous Bryce Canyon in Utah, USA, which features hoodoos across its landscape. Mobs found within eroded badlands are the same as regular badlands: Farm animals can only spawn on player-created grass blocks in this biome, and generate their warm variants if possible. Armadillos also inhabit eroded badlands. Eroded badlands generate in place of regular badlands in positive weirdness when humidity values are low, which often results in eroded badlands getting separated from badlands by a river.

Azalea trees are made of oak logs and azalea leaves on the surface. Their trunks grow straight up then on a diagonal halfway up the tree. Their roots consist of rooted dirt and hanging roots, which reach all the way down to the lush cave. Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a lush cave, including inside other caves or in biomes that are not grassy. This can sometimes produce jarring scenery, such as when the trees generate in snowy plains or mushroom islands. Azalea trees can generate in water up to 2 blocks deep, similarly to 'swamp' oaks. Unlike all other trees, however, the maximum depth is limited by the azalea's unique root system feature config rather than a 'surface_water_depth_filter' placement modifier. Azalea trees can be grown by using bone meal on azalea or flowering azalea. They do not automatically grow into an azalea tree, so bone meal must be used.

It just subtracts from zero \"borrowing\" from the next column like so: This is the same in binary. Let us, for example use a 4 bit binary number for the example: 1 11 111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 -0011 -0011 -0011 1 - 01 - 101 -1101 We could repeat this forever, but that would be useless. This is about what a 4 bit register does: it truncates after 4 bits worth of data. So after we truncate the number (which I kindly did for you in the example, otherwise the number would have an infinite number of 1's to the left). Thanks to this little perk, we can do whatever we want to the 0's after the four of them, including (which is fantastically useful later) adding a single 1 in front of them. Essentially what this is saying is that −b is just the inversion of b (exchange 1's for 0's and 0's for 1's) plus 1. What we have done is turn the first bit into a \"negative sign\" if it is on, but if you have been reading this you realize it is not that simple. Numbers that have a negative sign like this are commonly referred to as signed integers. Numbers like in a normal adder, where two's compliment is not taken into effect are called unsigned integers. Unsigned integers can go to a higher value, but cannot go below zero where as signed integers can go only half as high, but they can go equally as far below zero. This means that the two numbers have the same range, it is just in a different location like so (this is with an 8 bit number): It should be noted that some strange effects can take place when using the lowest signed value (in this case -128) so this should be avoided. Now that we have a positive way of representing our negative numbers it is very trivial to implement this into an adder. Currently our adder solves Therefore, if we enter the two's complement of B, our adder becomes a subtractor. This is easily implemented by using the Carry-in bit of the least significant (first) bit as the \"+1\" and then all that is left is to invert B.

Here, the users will decide what numbers they want to use. In the picture, a lever-based binary input system is used, so the users must decompose the numbers they want to use into powers of two. From this panel, the user chooses between the operations he is going to use: add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide (/). Like for the Number's Input Panel, this picture of the Operation Panel uses the lever system. These wires link the input panel and the operation panel to the different logic units. Try to rearrange them in a manner where the same values go together. So, your wires should look like, from left to right: A1; B1; A2; B2; A4; B4; ... The logic units in a calculator are the machines that perform the operations. The picture to the left shows a version of an adder/subtractor. Its construction is simple because it is modulated (made of many same parts). That means that if you use more bits, you can just add more parts on the side. However, this means that you'll have to change some links. In this machine, your inputs (in binary code) go into the bottom (yellow) full adders. Each adder needs the two inputs (A and B) with the same values. Also, the least significant bit has to be on the left, so they should all be connected by their carries. Basically, your inputs look like the wires in the Input Wires (white and orange) section. Use basic bridges to pass wires over the others without connecting them. Your A inputs (left) are the minuend (X in X-Y=Z), and go straight in the adders. The B inputs, your subtrahend (Y in X-Y=Z), have to pass through a multiplexer, made out of a modified version of a XOR gate which gives to the adder an inverted signal in case of a subtraction. The multiplexer is controlled by a switch (on the picture, that switch is on the left).",

True to its name, windswept gravelly hills contain large amounts of gravel that replace the top few layers of stone, grass blocks, and dirt across its landscape. Due to the gravel replacing most of the grass, spruce trees and oak trees generate far less often, along with reduced amounts of dandelions, poppies, bushes, and short grass, making this variant relatively barren. , no trees generate here at all, and almost 100% of the biome is covered with gravel, with only a few 1-block wide strips of grass blocks generating inside, allowing far fewer bushes to generate. Players should be careful when surfacing from underground in this biome, as the top layers of gravel can pose a suffocation hazard.

This can be used to create a BUD. Powered rails can be replaced by detector rails as a whole. Unless integrated with minecarts and detector rails, the powered rail BUD only outputs block updates, but it causes little delay and burden on the server, and are often used to transfer block updates. Powered rails, detector rails,rails and activator rails attached to trapdoors break when receiving NC updates after the trapdoor opens. This type of BUD can reset itself if used for a rail duper as rails reappear after breaking. As shown on the right, build a tripwire circuit missing one tripwire hook, trigger the tripwire, and place the missing hook on any half of a door. The tripwire hook breaks when activating the door but the door remains open. Other devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the BUD switch. By using a waterlogged block that is not allowed to flow (through the use of trapdoors or other techniques) and an observer clock, if the player updates the waterlogged block rapidly and the observer clock is in the same chunk the clock will break and give a constant output out of both sides. Then whenever the block is next updated, one side of the clock will pulse off for one tick. You can create a BUD switch using this by linking up using both sides as the output of the BUD. Video describing this phenomenon: By eliminating the reset mechanism of a BUD switch, it becomes a T-BUD or Toggle-BUD. This device has two stable states, which it switches between when it detects a block update next to the piston. This is equivalent to a normal BUD connected to a T Flip-Flop, but much simpler to build. It is useful for tracking the state of blocks like furnaces, grass block, dirt, and beds. However, it has useful capabilities for placing some blocks two blocks away. When placing a piece of redstone dust two blocks away, the T-BUD activates when it is destroyed only. When placing a repeater two blocks away, the T-BUD activates only on the placement. Note: As of Java Edition 1.7.4, the repeater in the picture must be set to a two tick delay.

Credits: design from \"samnrad\" ( YouTube This video demonstrates two-way engine A above, with long slime-block arms for harvesting, which shuttles between two prepared docks. It can be triggered by placing a block atop the pistons, or by switches at the stations. The harvested crops are launched at some speed, so this design may be better for an enclosed farm. Extensions are mechanical parts of a fully-automatic flying machine used to push an independent part of a large flying structure. A single piston only can push or pull up to 12 blocks. Extensions use additional pistons to \"extend\" a slime structure by allowing more blocks to be pushed. A one-way extension has 2 parts: a normal piston in the rear, and a slime block (or more) with a power source in the front with space between them. Once the rear part with the piston is pushed, the piston is activated by a power source from the front part. It pushes the slime block (and thus the next part of the flying contraption and its extensions), which pulls the power source with it. The piston then deactivates and prepares for another push. Some simple engines are just made of looped extensions, such that, at any given time one piston is always powered (in these machines it is important to place the redstone blocks last). A two-way extension consists of an observer powering at least one sticky piston which pushes or pulls a part of the flying contraption. This is possible only in Java Edition because it's the only version where sticky pistons (upon receiving a short redstone pulse) can push a block and then retract quickly without pulling it back. This type of extension either continuously pulls or pushes depending on whether the part it's supposed to move is initially retracted. If the part is initially retracted and the extension is continuously pulled, the sticky piston continuously pulls the part. On the other hand, if the part is one block away (\"not retracted\") and the extensions is continuously pushed, the sticky piston continuously pushes the part. This mechanism necessitates a switch within the flying machine to independently retract and extend the extension before flight, because otherwise, the engine most likely cannot push due to the \"stuck\" retracted extensions adding extra load to the engine's pistons. A flying machine can be designed to not only carry a player along, but allow them to control the machine in flight, starting, stopping, or changing directions.

      "chunk_text": "An acacia is a tree with gray bark and orange wood found in the savanna biome. Acacias are around 8 blocks tall and feature distinct diagonal trunks and often multiple canopies. The way acacias form is distinct. Acacia branches do not grow the same way as on other multi-branch trees (dark oak and giant jungle trees). Some acacias have many straight logs and a curve at the top, some at the bottom, and some curve from bottom to top. Typically, the canopy consists of just two layers of leaves, sometimes three. Acacia trees have high variability and can take many forms, such as: The common acacia has a diagonal trunk and a single canopy. The multi-canopy acacia has a trunk which forks around the middle of the plant. Each end ends in a canopy. Another form of multi-canopy acacia exists where a straight trunk is topped with a small canopy, out of which grows an additional trunk ending in a second, higher canopy. These trees often grow taller than the common acacia. Acacias spawn naturally only in the savanna biome and its variants, the savanna plateau and windswept savanna. These items can be obtained from all variants of acacia: (harvested with any tool including hands) (harvested with shears) (chance of dropping when breaking leaves) (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid) (created by an axe on a log) ( chance of dropping when leaves decay or are broken) Acacia saplings can be planted on: An acacia requires a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 6 blocks above the sapling (7 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, the tree requires 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow). Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, if an acacia is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or mountains biome, it has a blue-green hue. Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.",

Items are not pushed if the decorated pot is full or the pot contains a different item. Using a hopper (or a minecart with hopper) is the only way to retrieve items from a decorated pot without breaking it. Hoppers cannot interact with ender chests in any way. A working hopper pointing into the top of a furnace deposits only into the ingredient slot. It can push any item, including items that can't be smelted by the furnace. A hopper pointing into the side of a furnace deposits into the fuel slot, and only items that are usable as fuel. A hopper below a furnace pulls everything from the output slot and empty buckets from the fuel slot left over from using lava buckets as fuel. When a hopper removes items from a furnace, the experience points are 'stored' in the furnace until a player removes at least one smelted item, or the furnace block is broken. A sequence of three or more hoppers, each pushing items into the next, is called a hopper pipe. Working horizontal hopper pipes simply push items into each other at the expected rate of 2.5 items per second, but vertical hopper pipes are more complicated, as the hoppers are trying both to pull and to push. When a vertical pipe pulls from a single container, it simply transfers items at 2.5 items per second because the transfer rate is limited by the first hopper pulling items from the container. If a stack of items is in a vertical pipe, the items can be transferred twice as fast, because the hopper with the item stack is pushing items down while the hopper below it is also pulling items down. Hoppers and minecarts with hoppers can insert and remove items from the shelf. Items are inserted into the first empty slot and extracted from the first slot that contains items, following standard container behavior. Hoppers can insert music discs into jukeboxes, and extract the music discs after they finish playing. A jukebox emits a redstone signal while playing a disc, locking any adjacent hoppers. Hoppers cannot remove or place books on lecterns. The redstone pulse emitted from a lectern when a page is turned can temporarily lock hoppers. Unlocked hoppers fill minecarts with chests and minecarts with hoppers if any part of the entity's hitbox is within the hopper's target block-space.

When the input turns on, the outputs turn on in order (e.g., A then B), but when the input turns off, the outputs turn off in reverse order (e.g., B then A). The timing of the output activation and deactivation can be changed by adjusting the delay on the repeaters. All of these designs can be extended indefinitely. Earliest Known Publication: 5 July 2011 (basic concept), 20 June 2012 (Floor ABBA), and 18 July 2012 (Ceiling ABBA). The block update detector switch, or simply BUD, detects any time an adjacent block receives an update. An update is anything that changes that block's state: block placed, destroyed, door opened, repeater delay changed, cake eaten, grass growing, snow falling, furnace used (or turns off), and so on (chests opened and crafting tables used do not cause updates, sleeping in a bed does). When a block is updated, all adjacent blocks are also eligible for an update, and this can be used to produce a redstone signal or for other purposes. BUDs have been used for all kinds of things, from traps to detecting daylight to locking mechanisms on hidden doors. Current BUD switches take advantage of a quirk where pistons can receive power, but not updates, from blocks adjacent to the space the piston head occupies when extended. That is: blocks adjacent to the extended state and not adjacent to the retracted state provide power to extend the piston, but as they are not adjacent to the retracted state do not cause the piston to update when that power state changes. There are many models of auto resetting BUDs. This is done by having the firing of the BUD switch somehow cause the BUD switch to restore the pre-fired state often when fired it cuts the power to the piston, allowing it to retract. This is done either by extra circuitry or, as in the example below, by the properties of blocks themselves. Version 1.11 introduced the observer block, which sends a one-redstone-tick signal when the block it is facing is updated. However, many designs using BUDs still incorporate older piston variations. 1&times;3&times;4 (12 block volume) The sticky piston should be activated by quasi-connectivity, but it doesn't know that yet. When a block next to the piston is updated, the piston \"notices\" it should activate, and extends.

Afterward, it checks if the block above it is a type of container. If so, it attempts to pull from it. Otherwise, the hopper attempts to collect item entities. Notably, hoppers can push to and pull from other hoppers, forming hopper pipes or hopper chains, which allow transporting items across several blocks and are further discussed below. When a hopper receives a redstone signal, all three of its functions stop: in this situation the hopper is locked/disabled. Once the hopper loses power, its activity resumes as it goes back to being unlocked/enabled. Depowering a locked hopper does not affect its cooldown time. Therefore, unlocking a hopper that was not already in cooldown results in it starting to pull, push, or collect items as soon as it gets ticked. While a locked hopper does not push or pull/collect items, it may still receive items from droppers, crafters and other hoppers, and may have its items pulled out by another hopper beneath it. Hence, the item flow in a horizontal hopper pipe may be stopped by locking just one of the hoppers, but stopping a vertical hopper pipe requires locking two adjacent hoppers at the same time, such that both the pushing of the top one and the pulling of the bottom one are stopped. A hopper does not output any redstone signals by itself, but its fullness can be read using a redstone comparator, which needs to be placed next to it and facing away from it. An empty hopper outputs a signal strength of 0 and a completely full hopper outputs a signal strength of 15. Notably, a single stackable item (16 or 64) outputs a signal strength of 1 and a single non-stackable item outputs a signal strength of 3. , if the hopper being read is part of a horizontal hopper pipe, the comparator can individually read each item passing through the chain, because items are pushed through the hoppers one by one at a speed that is manageable by the comparator. If there is an uninterrupted stream of items, the comparator does not switch off in between items.",

      "chunk_text": "A full adder takes two inputs A and B and a Carry input and produces the Sum and Carry outputs. It relies on two XOR gates, two AND gates, and one OR gate. With some thought, these gates can be compressed (as both AND and XOR gates already exist in the game, and an OR gate can simply be a redstone wire). A and B are the bit inputs and C' is the carry in. It produces a sum at S and a carry out at C. When full adder modules are tiled together C' and C are connected, which allows the carry to propagate to the next module. The half adder is nearly identical to the full adder, except the second XOR gate is removed and the output from the first XOR gate becomes S. There is no carry in (C'), but the carry out (C) circuit is still on top of the first XOR gate and provides a carry to the first full adder. Some ALUs do not use a half adder for the first bit, to support INCREMENT (allow a carry in on the first bit). This full adder is similar to the previous one, except for the fact that it is two wide and the inputs are aligned vertically. This design is great for minimizing horizontal space and can be built in-line with two redstone buses, eliminating the space required to expand a bus to reach the inputs of a wider full adder. Gates: XNOR (2), IMPLIES, NOT, OR, AND Size: 6×12×5 (including I/O spaces) This adder takes 2 bits and a carried over bit (actually C, rather than C, a value held in the redstone in the bottom left corner on layer 1) and adds them all together, producing a sum (S) bit and a carry (actually C rather than C). When using the gates above; mind the inputs and outputs. You may be wondering why there are so many inverted signals being used instead of the regular signal. The adders shown here use XNOR gates rather than XOR gates because they are more compact, and as a result, implies gates must be used instead of AND gates, which also happen to be more compact. Therefore, for the most compact adder, inverse signals must be used. These adders are too complex to be easily deciphered with 2 layers per square, so each single layer has been drawn separately to ease the building process. This adder takes 2 bits and adds them together. The resulting bit is the output of S (sum). If both bits are 1, there is a carry over, and C becomes 1 (C becomes 0).",

Placing a block behind each of the input repeaters and moving the input/output lines closer to the repeaters' outputs means that signal strength is lost only in side movement at input, allowing an additional dust between the circuits (and thus a more efficient transmission), but requires that the transmission lines alternate which side they run on. Earliest known publication: December 21, 2012 ;observer-rail instant two-way repeater 1×12×4 (48 block volume) 1-wide, silent, instant transmission speed: instant circuit delay: 0 ticks fastest clock signal: 2-clock two-way reset time: 2-clock Behavior: The powered rails initially hold powered. When any input is given, the rails act as a BUD and depowers, spreading the pulse both ways. All of this happens in the same game tick. Inputs can be added by creating a block update anywhere in the chain, and outputs added by adding an observer anywhere. Variations: Can be coupled to a line of droppers for an instant item line (Inspector Talon, 2022). Earliest known publication: Aug 26, 2021 For simple redstone structures, digital (\"on/off\") transmission is sufficient. For complex redstone structures, with banks of inputs or outputs, more sophisticated forms of transmission may be required, such as analog, binary, or unary transmission. When numbers are represented by different types of transmission, they are said to be encoded. An analog encoding in Minecraft (a.k.a. hexadecimal wire or simply hex wire) is a transmission that outputs the same signal strength it receives as input. Because power levels can vary from 0 to 15, an analog transmission can convey 16 states in a single wire. ;Analog comparator wire (ACW) circuit delay: 1 tick per 4 blocks The simplest analog wire is a line of redstone comparators. Like redstone repeaters, comparators can draw a signal from one opaque block and push it into another; thus, it is usually more efficient in resources and in signal delay to place comparators every four blocks. This wire is best used for short distances and tricky turns. The signal strength of an analog comparator wire (ACW) can be reduced or suppressed at some point along its length by feeding another signal into one of the comparators in subtraction mode. The signal can be overridden by feeding a stronger signal into one of the opaque blocks. Because the redstone dust is not adjacent to any power or transmission components, only opaque blocks, it does not configure itself to point in any particular direction. This also causes the dust to power any opaque blocks or mechanism components to the side of the analog wire.",

When water comes into contact with concrete powder, the powder hardens into solid concrete. When a dry sponge comes into contact with a water source or flowing block, it becomes a wet sponge, absorbing all water within 3 to 5 blocks in all directions. Kelp and lily pads within the absorbed water blocks are destroyed and drop as items, and seagrass is destroyed without dropping anything.

Sponges do not absorb water from waterlogged blocks, nor water that comes into contact by flowing back in from outside the area of absorption. For instance, placing a sponge 4 or more blocks from a single water source removes the flowing water in the area of effect, but as the flow from the source resumes it is not affected by the wet sponge. A sponge instantly absorbs nearby water when it is placed next to water or when water comes into contact with it (by being placed next to the sponge, or by flowing toward it). A sponge absorbs water around itself (water source blocks or flowing water) out to a taxicab distance of 7 in all directions (including up and down), but won't absorb more than 65 blocks of water (water closest to the sponge is absorbed first).

When a chest is locked, the comparator doesn't realize that it shouldn't be turned on anymore. When the player updates the comparator, it realizes and resets the system.

For example, if the player has a fully repaired helmet and a damaged chestplate, leggings, and boots, only the latter 3 are considered in the random chance to be repaired. Durability doesn't affect which item is chosen at random. For example, a sword that is one durability point away from being fully repaired has an equal chance of being chosen as a pickaxe that is almost broken, even if this means less experience would be used to repair the sword.

For subsequent carts, you will need to right click carefully on the side hitbox of the track that the first cart is on. The top will not work, as the first cart is in the way. You'll know it worked if the minecart's shadow gets noticeably darker, or know, if your hand empties. Once you find the right spot, feel free to place as many TNT carts as you care to sacrifice. More carts means a bigger, more powerful explosion, and significantly less chance of escaping the blast (though it's not much of a chance to begin with). Just make sure not to bump the carts. Now is where things go from tricky to deadly. One wrong move will make you the victim of your own trap. This is when you hold Shift like your life depends on it, because it absolutely does. While holding Shift and not letting go, place the sculk sensor, either adjacent to or in front of your escape hole. Now, still holding Shift, sneak your way into your escape hole. This is where you finally close the gap in the Steve-sized wool wall hole, making sure there is no hole for the Sculk Sensor to hear you through. You should be safe by this point, but if you want to be extra careful, continue sneaking as you move away from your newly planted mine. That should be it!

It is the highest tier of hoe, having higher mining efficiency, durability, damage and enchantability than a diamond hoe. Like other diamond tools, a diamond hoe can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its durability and mining efficiency, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability. Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise. Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe. Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled. Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item. Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block. Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt. Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only damage . , hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.

Always remember that you need a block of space above a note block. Be careful with water as it destroys many redstone components on contact.

You can use buttons to start/stop instead of levers. It is possible to make a song with a certain section that keeps repeating until a signal comes through and moves to the next thing. This is achievable by making a closed circuit using redstone, repeaters, and note blocks, and use a hopper timer to time when to open the circuit and continue the song. By placing repeaters and note blocks in lines, it is possible to play multiple times. Another way is to put note blocks under detector rails, so as you ride along you can play the song of your choice! When making redstone music in vanilla Minecraft, it's very helpful to know how you can translate sheet music you find online into an actual note block circuit. The main two factors of music are rhythm and pitch. Rhythm is determined by how many repeaters you put before/after a note block, and how many ticks you set them to, and pitch is determined by how many times you right click a note block. Once you know how rhythm and pitches relate to ticks and note blocks, you can make an infinite number of songs. Pitch is one of the most important factors of music. Here is a table of how all notes in music that are able to be played on Minecraft can be simulated with note blocks. The table shows how many times to press the noteblock to get the desired pitch. Rhythm is another important factor of music, which is basically how long a note is held for. The next table shows how many redstone ticks, using repeaters, must go after a note block, depending on the tempo of the music, and what kind of rhythm the note is.",

Trapped chests are also an option but they can be seen by experienced players. Also, they can be seen more easily with resource packs. It is possible to detonate TNT with a pressure plate and a fishing rod. This method is mostly undetectable; however, it is unstable and prone to premature detonation if you don't have patience. A proximity trap is a player detector paired with an output. These traps' primary feature is the way they lure the target into the trap. Note that none of these lures work on mobs. You could drop items such as gold or diamonds near your trap to increase chances that someone will walk into it. This works best if you know someone is coming by. Some tips: It might look too obvious with diamonds, so it could be better to use items like iron bars. You could also try to make it look like someone just died. If you want to get elaborate, you could setup a dropper to periodically dispense an item. It would probably be possible to detect if the item was picked up, perhaps using a weighted pressure plate. Signs are useful for luring new, and sometimes even experienced, players into a trap. Here are some messages which can be good to lure players into traps. \"Free Diamonds!\" This could be good on a trapped chest, but would only work on newbies. \"DO NOT ENTER!\" Most players would be tempted to do exactly the opposite, even into a possible trap. \"DO NOT PRESS!\" If you see a button, you really want to press it. Especially if there is a sign saying not to. \"FREE ADMIN!\" Like the \"free diamonds\" example above, this probably works on newbies only. Chests, especially when paired with signs, can make a good lure. If you place one inconspicuously in a wooden house, what self respecting griefer would not go and investigate? Valuable blocks such as ores or mineral blocks make an irresistible lure. After all, if you saw a diamond ore just sitting there in a cave, would you just leave it there? This lure is good when paired with a BUD trigger or observer. Mineshafts are known for lots of loot. If you trap one, you can pretend to have 'accidentally given away directions' to the mineshaft. An iron door looks somewhat out of place in a dark cave. If a player sees one, they may be tempted to go inside. Unfortunately for them, there may only be a pressure plate on one side of the door, or a landmine hidden under the plate. When faced with a trap, the safest course of action is usually to leave the way you came. If the player really wants to disarm it though, here are some tips: Don't try to trip the trap and run away. Unless you have a really safe way of doing this, the trap is probably designed to prevent you from doing this. Watch out for observers. These can be placed inside walls and under pressure plates as a fail safe. Don't assume it is safe to break redstone. It is usually safer to keep redstone in its current state.",

The stopping block can be any movable block exept slime and glazed teracotta. i just used honeyblocks because they are easy to break.\" --FirewolfQuasar Dimensions: 4x4*x4, JE 1.16+ Materials: 4 observers, 4 sticky pistons, 15* honey blocks. For seating: 1+ minecart(s), 1 rail, 1 block(temporary). Important note: The build is directional and must be built aligned per the schematic with N facing north. This is a restriction due to the update order of the blocks. This build does not work with slime blocks. # Place all the honey blocks and sticky pistons first. # Install the observers. With honey block B (the brake) in place, the pistons don't push if they receive a redstone pulse. # The optional minecart can be added, by placing any temporary block at T, placing the rail on it, then the cart. Mine block T and recover it and the rail. This need not be slime as pictured, it just mines quickly. # Options: The honey blocks marked * are optional. If they are in place, any movable block except slime and glazed terracotta can be used to stop by placing it at B. If the * honey blocks aren't used, the piston push limit isn't exceeded, so the brake B block must be a honey block to restrict the pistons. Honey blocks mine easily and have a high rate of recovery in this design, so do make for an effective brake. Usage: Stand on the north-west honey block (or sit in the minecart). Take note of the pistons and choose the one that pushes in the direction you wish to travel. Then update its respective observer. Place a torch, button, or other disposable block on the face or otherwise trigger the observer. The disposable item breaks or is abandoned when the observer is moved with the machine. Collision behavior: When the flyer collides with immovable blocks (bedrock, obsidian, furnaces,...), it changes direction depending on its current direction of travel: North: Begins moving west. West: Begins moving north. South: Begins moving east. East: Begins moving south. If the machine cannot travel in the new direction, it halts. This allows for the construction of 'docks' that are easy to park the machine at, as it favours settling into north-west or south-east corners of immovable blocks.

This can all be implemented into an adder like so: A control bit is added to the circuit such that when it is on, the unit subtracts, and when it is off the unit adds. After this, add XOR gates between the control bit and each B input. Route the output of each XOR to the B input of each adder. Finally, to make the unit Two's compliment compatible, a final XOR gate must be added between the control bit and the carry out of the most significant bit. This is the simplest way to implement negatives and subtraction in a CPU, as it adds gracefully and store well in registers. If this is to be implemented in a calculator, simply subtract 1 from the output and then invert all the outputs except the most significant one. The most significant bit is on if the number is negative. In order to make a subtracter, simply invert one of the binary inputs (the 1st or 2nd number). If the number is negative, the answer comes out inverted. In real computers, the first bit (also called the sign) decides whether the number is positive or negative, if you include this (applying the same inverting rule) you can detect whether the number is negative, or if it is just a big number. In circuits, it might be useful to have a logic unit that determines which output is to be chosen based on its input. Such a unit can then be used for more complex circuits, such as an ALU. This is an example of a 2-bit logic unit having four states depending on the input. The outputs are in top row, with 11, 00, 01, 10 order (input order: first first, bottom second). This is another example of a simplified version using Gray codes. The output appears at the torches at the end of the top rows. This design can be extended to any number of bits, but practical limitations due to timing considerations restrict the use of more than a byte or so. The outputs are triggered by the inputs 11, 01, 00, 10, respectively. The Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is the central part of the CPU. It does calculations and logical processing and then passes this information to a register. The ALU, on basis of the input, selects a specific function, performs it, and then gives the result.

If both conditions are satisfied, there is a (~17.6%) chance for it to drip water and fill the cauldron by one level. If there is a lava source above the stalactite, there is a (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron with lava instead, making lava a renewable resource. Refilling a cauldron with water or lava averages nearly one Minecraft day (19+ minutes) although the actual time for any individual refill varies. If mud is placed above a block with a stalactite underneath, the mud eventually turns into clay. There is a (~17.2%) chance of this happening when the block gets randomly ticked. This conversion does not happen in the Nether. Stalagmites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the ground. Falling onto the top most block of a stalagmite multiplies the fall distance by two to calculate the total amount of fall damage, using the formula ceil(fall_distance &times; 2 &minus; 2). A player or mob gets damage each time they jump on top of a single stalagmite (with a normal jump height of blocks). The distance traveled during the last game tick of falling time is not included in this calculation, making it slightly off at higher distances; see for more information. If a player dies from falling onto a stalagmite, the death message \" was impaled on a stalagmite\" appears. All mobs that are immune to fall damage do not take damage from falling into stalagmites; the same applies to the player if the game rule fallDamage is set to false. It is possible to climb up portions of stalagmites entirely composed of differently sized parts because of the different collision box sizes of the pointed dripstone that it composes of. Dripstone columns can be found naturally in dripstone caves, they are formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together in mid-air. Columns can be created manually by stacking pointed dripstones on either the stalactite or the stalagmite or both until they join together, the last pointed dripstone placed being the most slender part of the whole column.",

An anvil has limited durability, and as it is used or dropped too far, gradually becomes a chipped anvil, then a damaged anvil, then breaks and vanishes. The suitable tool to break anvil is pickaxe. Anvil needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing. Anvil drops itself when it's destroyed. A damaged anvil generates in the \"Forge room\" of the woodland mansion and in trail ruins. A total of 31 iron ingots (including 27 for three blocks of iron) are required to craft an anvil. Anvils have two modes to repair items that have a durability rating: As with the grindstone, a player may repair items by combining two similar items. With the anvil, however, the target retains its enchantments and may gain new ones from the sacrificed items. Alternatively, a player can use materials originally required in the crafting of the item (iron ingots for iron items with durability, diamonds for diamond items with durability) to repair a single item. One material can repair 25% of the target's maximum durability. This is a good deal in the case of a chestplate, for example; a full repair (four materials) would total only half of the item's original cost (eight materials). In the case of tools and weapons, however, this may be a significantly less economical option; combining two diamond shovels would cost two diamonds in total, while up to four diamonds could be required to directly repair one. Still, it may be worth making the more expensive upgrade if the enchantments are considered difficult to obtain. If the items are unable to be combined, a red \"X\" appears over the arrow pointing to the slot of the resulting item. Also, if the target item is at full durability and the sacrifice does not have any enchantments, the anvil also refuses to combine the items, unless if renaming the item to a valid name. In addition, the player can rename any item – not just items with durability – by using an anvil. Repairing with materials works for the most part, but not with all items: in general, repairing works for items with their material in the default name.",

We can easily implement this using 3 \"punch cards\" that consist of solid blocks and air. The \"punch cards\" or the masks are being moved by pistons with slime blocks. So the signal is only being propagated if all three layers of masks align in a specific way. Open the picture to see the layers. (The \"Bit 2\" slice has a slight error on the left side, and the solid blocks should be shifted left one block.) As you can see, this system is very compact and comprehensible. You can use this in reverse as well (not as a multiplexer, but if you reverse the repeaters the signal from every ex-outptut (0–7) will only propagate if it matches the current state of the demultiplexer, so it works like \"Output3 = (Input3) AND (Demux=011)\"). A series of gates that converts a 3-bit binary input to a single active line out of many. They are useful in many ways as they are compact, 5×5×3 at the largest. As there are many lines combined using implicit-ORs, you have to place diodes before each input into a circuit to keep signals from feeding back into other inputs. Requirements for each output line (excluding separating diodes): A series of gates that converts a 4-bit binary input to a single active line out of many (e.g. 0-9 if the input is decimal or 0-F if the input is hexadecimal). They are useful in many ways as they are compact, 3×5×2 at the largest. As there are many lines combined using implicit-ORs, you have to place diodes before each input into a circuit to keep signals from feeding back into other inputs. Requirements for each output line (excluding separating diodes): You also can convert a 1-of-16 signal to a 4-bit binary number. You only need 4 OR gates, with 8 inputs each. These have to be isolating ORs to prevent signals from feeding back into other inputs. For every output line, make an OR gate with the inputs wired to the input lines where there is a '1' in the table below. The example on the right uses ORs (>=1), XNORs (=), RS NOR latches (SR) and some delays (dt*). For the XNORs I would prefer the C-design. The example on the right uses a 4-bit design, so you can handle a hexadecimal key. So you can use 15 various digits, [1,F] or [0,E]. You only can use 15, because the state (0)16 = (0000)2 won't activate the system. If you want to handle 16 states, you edit the logic, to interact for a 5-bit input, where the 5th bit represents the (0)16 state. In the following we'll use (0)16 = (1111)2.

Creaking hearts that spawn creakings at night can often be found here. Pale gardens are a biome variant of dark forests which generate adjacent to dark forests in areas of high continentalness and weirdness. They mainly consist of pale oak trees, along with pale moss patches made of pale moss blocks and pale moss carpets, and scattered eyeblossoms. Pale hanging moss can also be found hanging off the trees. Some of the pale oak trees contain a creaking heart block, which spawns a creaking when activated at night. Woodland mansions can generate in pale gardens. The water, sky, and blocks of the biome are desaturated. With Vibrant Visuals, the pale garden has an extremely dense pale fog that blocks all skylight and limits the view to only a few chunks. Pale gardens are rare. Besides dark forests, pale gardens uncommonly border old growth pine taigas, forests, birch forests, meadows, jungles and groves, with an even smaller chance to border old growth birch forests, taigas, frozen peaks, sparse jungles and bamboo jungles. Unlike most biome variants, pale gardens are not separated from dark forests by rivers most of the time, though a river commonly generates nearby. Ambient music does not play in pale gardens. If a music track is playing while the player enters the biome, it fades into silence. The music resumes when the player exits the biome. Creakings are found in this biome only at night, but their spawning is controlled by creaking hearts, not the biome. Since naturally generated Pale Oaks only have a 20% chance to include a creaking heart, it is possible to have Pale Gardens with no creaking hearts and no creakings, especially if they are smaller areas. Regular passive mobs do not naturally spawn in the pale garden, but normal hostile mobs can spawn here, sometimes even during the day because of the thick foliage.

Let's say for sake of argument that there is 1×1×1 block NOT affected by the sticky pistons, this is the safety block. When you activate input A, the door opens and the floor drops, if you're standing on the safety block, then you cannot fall. Input B controls only the floor, but if input A is on then input B controls them both. When both are on, input A affects only the floor. This means if you are off the server and want no one in, leave A and B on, when they deactivate A, the floor drops, but the door stays closed, so if they know the secret, they still cannot get in. Carry input and output are aligned to easily connect many of these modules in series. When building advanced digital circuits like computers and multipliers, the adders used must be as fast as possible to ensure maximum running speed. Simple adders have one fundamental speed problem that numerous adder designs try to correct to speed up. The issue is carry propagation delay: delay caused by the way adders borrow carries. We can see this when we do the problem 1111 + 0001: This is the first step of the addition process, XORing the two inputs. Because there were two 1s in the least significant bit, the AND gate activates and carries to the next bit: But here is the issue: You now need to borrow a carry again, because, in the two's place, there are two ones. This is done by ANDing the output of the first half-adder with the carry from the previous bit and this is a huge issue. Because, for the next bit, you AND the borrowed carry again, and again. Each AND gate takes 2 ticks, so, in order to calculate all of the carries that need to be added up in the final step, it takes 2 ticks times 4 bits, or 8 ticks. Imagine you see the problem 999 + 1. You don't sit around thinking \"9 + 1 is 10, carry 1, so 9 + 1 is 10, carry the 1, so 9 + 1 is 10, so 1000.\" It's the same situation in an advanced circuit.",

Stalagmites (which point ) deal extra damage to players and mobs that land on them. Pointed dripstone can be mined with any tool, but pickaxes are the quickest. Pointed dripstone breaks instantly when hit by a thrown trident. However, it cannot be broken with any other projectile. Pointed dripstone can be found in dripstone caves in cluster formations. It also generates in trial chambers (a trapped variant of spiral staircases, as well as the \"Encounter 4\" room). Wandering traders may sell 2 pointed dripstones for 1 emerald. Pointed dripstone can grow only if it is hanging directly under a dripstone block while there is a water source above (not a waterlogged block). In addition, if there is a solid block less than eleven blocks below this stalactite, a stalagmite grows on that block toward the stalactite. This growth does not occur if the stalactite's tip is waterlogged and a stalagmite below does not grow if its tip is waterlogged. They do not grow to more than seven blocks long. Every time the block receives a random tick, there is a small chance of 1.138% () for a stalactite or stalagmite to grow one block, meaning that every single growth step takes an average time of 5 in-game days (100 minutes). Pointed dripstone comes in two different forms, stalactites and stalagmites. Placing a pointed dripstone between a stalagmite and stalactite without sneaking connects them. It can be waterlogged.

If the block supporting a stalactite or any block of the stalactite is broken, all of the unsupported pointed dripstone below the broken block drops, causing damage to any player and mobs standing beneath it, similar to a falling anvil.

The BUD switch now has a compact block form in-game and it was added in 1.11 snapshot 16w39a called the 'Observer'. The observer does not detect block updates, instead it detects block state changes. Many BUD switch designs exploit a property of pistons called quasi-connectivity. A piston can receive power through a space one block above itself. In this case, the power source is either above and to the side of the piston, or two blocks above it. However, when powered in this way, the piston does not immediately notice changes in the state of the power source. When some other block update happens next to the piston, it will \"wake up\" and react to the change. By forming a feedback loop, where the state of the piston controls the state of its power source, it becomes the sensor of a simple BUD switch: In this design, the piston will only extend in response to an adjacent block update, but after extending it will immediately retract because the arm of the piston notices the repeater next to it turning off. This is how a piston BUD resets itself: by having the power run next to the extended piston arm, with a delay. Note: If the block diagonally adjacent to the sticky piston becomes horizontally adjacent, the circuit will constantly pulse instead. This design can be extended with multiple sensor blocks. All of the pistons in this design are sensors.",

      "chunk_text": "A telegraph in Minecraft works identically to a real telegraph device, sending a series of redstone pulses over long distances to be decoded and interpreted by a receiving party. There are multiple designs, from the simple flashing redstone torch, to massive machines capable of reviewing, deleting, and editing messages before sending them to their destination. This tutorial will explain how to operate these devices, and how to create your own. All telegraphs, no matter how basic or complex they are, require four things: a sending device, sometimes an inverter, redstone wire, and a receiving device. The sender will just about always be in the form of a lever. Anything else, such as a button or pressure plate, cannot be easily used to create a message, as they will remain activated for at least 0.9 seconds. A lever, on the other hand, can be shut off as soon as the player wants to, allowing for the quick pulses needed for telegraph languages such as Morse code. After the sender comes the inverter, a simple logic gate that inverts its input to create the output. For instance, if the input wire is powered, the output wire will be off. These are almost always used in telegraphs because redstone torches (a common type of receiver) create their own power. This means that without an inverter, the torch will turn off when a pulse is sent. Although this is only an issue of appearance, it may lead to confusion during interpretation of the message, which is tricky enough by itself. Then comes the all-important wire, which allows you to send your message as far as you want (although the longer the wire, the more likely it is that something goes wrong). The wire consists of redstone wire, and, depending on its length, redstone repeaters placed on every fifteenth block. This will stretch out for as long as needed, until it reaches its destination; the receiver. Receivers can be anything from a redstone torch that blinks when a single pulse is received to a room filled with redstone repeaters, displaying the entire message before the player. A sending device is the mechanism used to transmit a series of pulses to the receiver, whether it creates those pulses or simply allows a looping message to enter the telegraph line. It can be one of three objects; a lever, a button, or a pressure plate. Levers are by far the most common of all sending devices, and are the most practical choice in nearly every scenario.

Lava flows far more slowly than water (1 block every 30 game ticks, or 1.5 seconds), and sourceless lava flows linger for a short time more. In the Nether, lava travels 7 blocks horizontally and spreads 1 block every 10 game ticks, or 2 blocks per second, which is half the speed of water in the Overworld. In all dimensions, lava spreading uses the same mechanic as water: For every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. (This can result in lava flows turning toward dropoffs that they cannot reach in the Overworld and the End.) Flowing lava destroys certain non-solid blocks similarly to water. However, those blocks do not drop their loot when destroyed by lava. Sugar canes hold back lava, but disappear if the sugar cane's water source is destroyed by the lava. A one-block lava flow can be redirected by receiving block updates, which causes it to reset the flow toward the now-nearest terrain depression, but does not cut off its current direction of flow. The change cannot be reversed. In Bedrock Edition the /setblock command can be used to create stationary lava without the use of barriers.

The game prevents certain blocks from being obtained through normal gameplay methods, such as crafting, the Creative inventory, the pick block key, and the Silk Touch enchantment. It also prevents such blocks from being given through less conventional methods, such as inventory editing, mods, and commands. Until 1.7.2 and 1.8, there had been a wide variety of blocks that could be edited into the inventory; over time, however, the game was updated so that these blocks became entirely unavailable, even though one utilized inventory editing. From Java Edition 1.13 onwards, blocks and items are completely different concepts, and numerical IDs no longer exist at all. Currently, the game only accepts resource locations (such as minecraft:dirt) in most commands, and uses these resource locations when assigning blocks to the inventory and save files. The old method of obtaining a block via numerical IDs is no longer an option because the numerical id method getItemById(Integer.parseInt(id)) is no longer used in command /give.

A mature sweet berry bush yields 2–3 sweet berries. On its third growth stage, it yields 1–2 sweet berries. Each level of Fortune can increase the amount of drops by 1. Sweet berries can be collected from a sweet berry bush by pressing the control on it, yielding 1–2 sweet berries in its third growth stage, and 2–3 sweet berries in its final growth stage. After dropping the berries on the ground, the sweet berry bush reverts to its second growth stage. Placing sweet berries on a grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots creates a small sweet berry bush that eventually becomes a fully grown sweet berry bush. A sweet berry bush grows through four stages after it is planted. Its first growth stage is a small bush without any berries. It becomes a grown plant in its second stage, and produces berries in its third and fourth growth stage. The bush needs to be in light level 9 or greater to grow.",

For simpler mechanisms, see electronic mechanisms, wired traps, and redstone. In Minecraft, several in-game systems can usefully perform information processing. These systems include water, sand, minecarts, pistons, and redstone. Of all these systems, only redstone was specifically added for its ability to manipulate information, in the form of redstone signals. Redstone, like electricity, has high reliability and high switching-speeds, which has seen it overtake the other mechanical systems as the high-tech of Minecraft, just as electricity overtook the various mechanics such as pneumatics to become the high-tech of our world. In both modern digital electronics and redstone engineering, the construction of complex information processing elements is simplified using multiple layers of abstraction. The first layer is that of atomic components; redstone/redstone torches/redstone repeaters/blocks, pistons, buttons, levers and pressure plates are all capable of affecting redstone signals. The second layer is binary logic gates; these are composite devices, possessing a very limited internal state and usually operating on between one and three bits. The third layer is high-level components, made by combining logic gates. These devices operate on patterns of bits, often abstracting them into a more humanly comprehensible encoding like natural numbers. Such devices include mathematical adders, combination locks, memory-registers, etc. In the fourth and final layer, a key set of components are combined to create functional computer systems which can process any arbitrary data, often without user oversight. These circuits simply convert inputs of a given format to another format. Converters include Binary to BCD, Binary to Octal, Binary to Hex, BCD to 7-Segment, etc. You can understand this design as a combination of AND gates. Demultiplexer is a circuit that uses the following logic: Output 0 = (~bit2) & (~bit1) & (~bit0) Output 1 = (~bit2) & (~bit1) & (bit0) The most obvious way to implement a demultiplexer would be to put a whole bunch of logic gates and connect them together, but even with 3 or 4 bits it turns into a mess. If you look at the binary numbers table, you can notice a pattern. If the number of bits is Q, the most significant bit reverses every Q/2 numbers, the next bit reverses every Q/4 numbers an so on until we get to the Qth bit.",

There were multiple prototypes for what ultimately became the warden. According to Jasper Boerstra, it went through 175 different concept iterations to ensure that the warden was \"something really special\". The very first warden iteration created was a modified cow that made the lights and torches flicker and served as the main prototype for the darkness effect. Some known concepts and names for the warden from this time were the \"shade\", the \"stalker\" and the \"hollowed\". The shade was a vaguely humanoid translucent mob with glowing eyes. It was meant to be a more ambient mob, which would stand in darkness with only its eyes visible and would slowly fade away as the player approached it. It would also imitate the noise of other mobs, making it sound as though they were right behind the player. Rather than an iteration on the warden, by then called the \"stalker\", the shade had come to be a completely separate mob to the stalker, though in some concepts it was meant to be sort of complementary, living in the ancient cities and helping the stalker by tricking players into alerting it. It was eventually scrapped due to a feeling that it would grow to become annoying rather than creepy, and so the team could better focus on developing the stalker. It is unknown whether the shade was ever implemented into the game as a prototype. Another early prototype was the stalker. Several pieces of concept art were created for this iteration of the mob, and a prototype of the original stalker design was programmed into the game. The first stalker iteration was a mob that could spawn anywhere deep underground. Stalkers could make torches flicker off and on when nearby. The stalker was tall and asymmetrical with a glowing core, sometimes referred to as a chest crystal.",

Using this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece.

Thus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.
