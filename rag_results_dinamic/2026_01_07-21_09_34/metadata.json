Pale moss blocks can be mined using any tool or by hand, but a hoe is the quickest way to break it. Pale moss blocks can be found on pale moss patches inside of pale gardens. Wandering traders may sell 2 pale moss blocks for 1 emerald. When bone meal is on a pale moss block, moss spreads to any of the blocks listed below, if they have air blocks above them, in a corner-less 7×11×7 volume centered on the original pale moss block. Foliage can replace air on any of these blocks. The following blocks can be replaced with pale moss blocks: When a pale moss block generates, it has a chance to have short grass, tall grass, or a pale moss carpet growing on it. Most plants can be placed on pale moss except for cacti. Small dripleaves can be placed on pale moss, but only underwater. Big dripleaves cannot be placed on pale moss. Nether fungi can also be placed on it, while mushrooms can be placed only at light level 12 or below. Mushrooms placed on pale moss can be grown into huge mushrooms. Unlike regular moss blocks, pale moss blocks cannot be used to increase the hatching speed of sniffer eggs. Placing a pale moss block into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Pale moss blocks are destroyed and dropped as items when pushed by pistons.

Any mobs immune to fire damage cannot take damage from magma blocks. However, a few mobs like shulkers cannot take magma block damage despite not having natural immunity to fire. Magma blocks do not set mobs or players on fire and thus do not cook the animals that they kill, nor do they destroy items. Blocks that are the height of a trapdoor or lower (such as snow layers, carpets, repeaters, or comparators) do not prevent a magma block from damaging mobs and players above it. However, a sunken boat on top of the magma block prevents damage. There are a few specific death messages associated with magma blocks. If a player or named pet is killed simply from standing on the block, the death message displayed in the chat is: \"[player] discovered the floor was lava\". If a player or named pet was attacked and knocked back to their death onto magma blocks, the message is: \"[player] walked into danger zone due to [player/mob]\". Magma blocks emit a light level of 3. They do not melt ice or snow. Magma blocks emit smoke particles under rainfall, much like lava. Making walls out of magma blocks prevents spiders from climbing them. Mobs try to avoid walking over magma blocks but still walk over them if no other path is found. Most mobs do not spawn on magma blocks (exceptions are magma cubes, zombified piglins, ghasts, and squid). When a magma block's top is set on fire, the fire burns indefinitely, similar to netherrack.

These items include helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can be placed in designated slots in a player's inventory. These items can be worn in armor slots, but do not provide protection against damage: Mob or Player heads There are eight different types of materials of armor, including turtle shells. The seven full sets are shown below in order from weakest to strongest. A full set of leather, copper, iron, golden, or diamond armor requires 24 units of a given material to craft. Netherite armor cannot be crafted directly, and is obtained by upgrading diamond armor in a smithing table. A turtle shell is a type of helmet, but no other armor items can be crafted from turtle scutes. Chainmail armor is uncraftable, and can be obtained only from mob drops, trading, and generated loot. Netherite armor is obtained by upgrading diamond armor in a smithing table. Each piece of netherite armor requires a netherite ingot and a netherite upgrade smithing template. A full set of netherite armor requires 4 netherite ingots and 4 netherite upgrade smithing templates. Netherite armor retains the enchantments, prior work penalty, and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond armor. Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate. Zombies, husks, zombie villagers, skeletons, strays, bogged, and piglins that spawn with armor have an 8.5% chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player.

Single-torch repeaters use slightly less redstone than redstone repeaters (16 redstone per 17 blocks) but are slightly slower (1 tick delay per 17 blocks). An instant repeater is a circuit that repeats a redstone signal change with no delay. A sequence of instant repeaters and redstone dust lines is known as instawire (or \"instant wire\"). ;Insta-drop instant repeater [Java Edition only] 1×3×2 (6 block volume) circuit delay: none Behavior (rising-edge): While the input is off, the block of redstone keeps the lower sticky piston activated by connectivity. When the input turns on, the upper sticky piston begins to extend the block of redstone. The instant the block of redstone starts moving, the lower sticky piston deactivates and begins to retract block A, the reason the upper piston is extending — this turns the upper sticky piston's extension into a 0-tick extension/retraction (the \"insta-drop\": the sticky piston \"drops\" its grip on the block and leaves it behind when it retracts), leaving the block of redstone above the lower sticky piston and powering the output. All of this happens instantly (in the same redstone tick), effectively allowing a rising edge to pass through the circuit with no delay. Now that the block of redstone is above the lower sticky piston, the lower sticky piston extends again, and two ticks later block A is back in position causing the upper sticky piston to extend again, ready to retract block A when the signal turns off. Behavior (falling-edge): When the input turns off, the upper sticky piston begins to retract the block of redstone, immediately cutting off power to the output, effectively allowing the falling edge to pass through the circuit with no delay. While the block of redstone is moving, the lower sticky piston deactivates, but then activates again when the block of redstone stops moving and can activate the lower sticky piston by connectivity again.

The moving block of redstone also instantly depowers the dust below it, but by the time that turns off the repeater's output, the block of redstone has arrived to continue powering the output.",

It is used to till dirt-related blocks into farmland, and to break leaves, haybales, and sculk-related blocks faster. It is the fourth-highest tier of hoe, having higher mining efficiency, durability, and enchantability than a stone hoe. A copper hoe can be used to harvest various plant blocks, Nether fungi, and sculk blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability. Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise. A copper hoe can be used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe. A copper hoe can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled. A copper hoe can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item. Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a copper hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block. A copper hoe is unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt. A copper hoe always attacks instantly. A copper hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding copper ingots, with each ingot restoring 47 durability (25% of its maximum durability, rounded down). Two copper hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the copper hoe's enchantments. A copper hoe can receive the following enchantments:",

Wheat crops are planted in farmland and used to grow wheat and wheat seeds. Wheat seeds can be obtained from breaking short grass, tall grass, fern or large fern, which have a 12.5% chance to yield 1 seed. If harvested with a tool enchanted with Fortune, the drop rate is increased to 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. Harvesting fully-grown crops yields 1 unit of wheat and between 1 and 4 seeds (about seeds/crop harvested on average) , or between 0 and 3 seeds . The looting is calculated by a binomial distribution: a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of around 57% to yield the 1–4 or 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one. Village farm plots have a chance of being wheat crops. The exact chance depends on the style of the village: Wandering traders may sell wheat seeds for 1 emerald. Nitwit and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds at players under the Hero of the Village effect. Wheat seeds can be placed on farmland by right-clicking, where they grow through eight stages. When left alone, wheat seeds planted on farmland grow to become wheat crops, which can be harvested by the player. Seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant and 9 or greater to grow. they can be planted at any light level but need an internal light level of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted on is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5. Breaking the final stage produces 1 to 4 wheat seeds (or more with Fortune) and 1 wheat. If they are harvested early, they drop 1 seed without any wheat. Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

Elytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30°). A player in flight who drops to 0 speed quickly accelerates back up to at least this minimum. The player can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they typically do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed and slows an aircraft; Minecraft also mimics this. Sharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player should aim to glide just above the target then immediately reverse direction right over the target, making adjustments as necessary. With the right technique, it is actually possible to glide as far, as high, and for as long as the player wants, until the elytra breaks. First, start from 50 blocks above the ground, though around 80 blocks up is ideal. Fly down with a pitch between 32-33° to build up speed until you lose about 60-70 blocks of altitude. Then, immediately pitch up to about -50°, and slowly pitch down by +0.5° per tick (+10° per second) until reaching 32 degrees again, and repeat. If done correctly, the player can gain 3 blocks of altitude per cycle, though it may be possible to gain up to 10 blocks of altitude per cycle on average. The lowest rate of altitude loss without changing your pitch is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12° or 15°). To get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude) without changing pitch, the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon (0°). This ratio is about 10.06 blocks travelled horizontally per 1 block of starting altitude on average. This does not include the time and altitude that it takes to build up speed. Slow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling).

The multi-canopy acacia has a trunk which forks around the middle of the plant. Each end ends in a canopy. Another form of multi-canopy acacia exists where a straight trunk is topped with a small canopy, out of which grows an additional trunk ending in a second, higher canopy.

It collects dropped instances of its held item and drops them near the player or note block it is currently following. Allays spawn only during world generation, but they can also be duplicated; see below. Allays have a 50% chance of spawning in dark oak cages near pillager outposts in groups of 1-3. Allays also have a 50% chance to spawn inside jail cells within woodland mansions in groups of 1-3. The allay's luminous texture allows it to be seen clearly in the dark, although it doesn't illuminate its surroundings. The allay is small, peaceful, and flies aimlessly until a player gives it an item with their key. The allay starts following the player and seeks out dropped versions of the same item to deliver them to the player. The allay returns to wandering around if any player takes its item back by an empty hand on it. The allay locks onto the player who last gave it an item. This allay follows the player from up to a 64-block cubic area away and seeks items up to a 32-block cubic area away from the player. After delivering items, the allay has a delay of three seconds until it can seek items again. An allay has a single inventory slot to hold a stack of items (usually 64 items) in addition to the item it got from the player. While the allay does not discern enchantments, special item names, or items in shulker boxes when it seeks, it still carries such items in separate trips. Allays don't pick up any items if the game rule is , but the player can still give the allay items with the key. If the allay hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location while delivering items, it instead delivers its items to the note block. Then it spends 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. The allay returns to targeting its player after 30 seconds. A vibration particle emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate that the allay has locked onto the note block. While an allay is focused on a note block, it responds only to sound from that note block, which resets the time until the allay loses interest. This in principle allows allays to focus on a single note block while other note blocks are playing in the vicinity, thus allowing many allays to work in parallel with different note blocks. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing wool between the note block and the allay can prevent this sound interaction. The allay can pick up items within a radius of about 1.3 blocks from itself and drop items up to 3 blocks away from its player or note block. An allay performs a dance animation when there is a nearby jukebox playing.",

      "chunk_id": "tutorialtelegraph_1",
      "chunk_text": "A telegraph in Minecraft works identically to a real telegraph device, sending a series of redstone pulses over long distances to be decoded and interpreted by a receiving party. There are multiple designs, from the simple flashing redstone torch, to massive machines capable of reviewing, deleting, and editing messages before sending them to their destination. This tutorial will explain how to operate these devices, and how to create your own. All telegraphs, no matter how basic or complex they are, require four things: a sending device, sometimes an inverter, redstone wire, and a receiving device. The sender will just about always be in the form of a lever. Anything else, such as a button or pressure plate, cannot be easily used to create a message, as they will remain activated for at least 0.9 seconds. A lever, on the other hand, can be shut off as soon as the player wants to, allowing for the quick pulses needed for telegraph languages such as Morse code. After the sender comes the inverter, a simple logic gate that inverts its input to create the output. For instance, if the input wire is powered, the output wire will be off. These are almost always used in telegraphs because redstone torches (a common type of receiver) create their own power. This means that without an inverter, the torch will turn off when a pulse is sent. Although this is only an issue of appearance, it may lead to confusion during interpretation of the message, which is tricky enough by itself. Then comes the all-important wire, which allows you to send your message as far as you want (although the longer the wire, the more likely it is that something goes wrong). The wire consists of redstone wire, and, depending on its length, redstone repeaters placed on every fifteenth block. This will stretch out for as long as needed, until it reaches its destination; the receiver. Receivers can be anything from a redstone torch that blinks when a single pulse is received to a room filled with redstone repeaters, displaying the entire message before the player. A sending device is the mechanism used to transmit a series of pulses to the receiver, whether it creates those pulses or simply allows a looping message to enter the telegraph line. It can be one of three objects; a lever, a button, or a pressure plate. Levers are by far the most common of all sending devices, and are the most practical choice in nearly every scenario. They can create as long or as short a pulse as the sending party wishes, and are the most accurate representations of real life telegraph keys. The only situation that a button could be used is in a one-way telegraph system for distress signals to other players in multiplayer. However, the receiver would not remain activated due to buttons automatically returning to the 'off' position after only 0.9 seconds.",

Items contained in the chest are dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large trapped chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed trapped chest are dropped and the remaining trapped chest continues to function as a small trapped chest. Trapped chests naturally generate in \"fake end portal rooms\" in woodland mansions. They always contain two ender pearls and activate the two nearby TNT blocks when opened. Trapped chests can be used as containers and as redstone components. To place a trapped chest, the face of a block adjacent to the space the trapped chest should occupy.

      "chunk_text": "Erosions, also known as basins, are rare terrain features that strip away the top layer of a biomes surface, leaving a one-block deep hole with a stony floor. They can generate in all three dimensions, and are intentional. In the Overworld, the floors of erosions are always replaced with stone. They expose ores such as coal ore, copper ore and iron ore. In badlands erosions, gold ore can also be seen. Erosions in The Nether replace the floor with netherrack. Nether erosions can expose ore such as nether gold ore and nether quartz ore. Because erosions generate independent of the y-axis, if an erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang. Since erosions generate before features, chorus plants can take root in End erosions. The floor of End erosions is always end stone. When the game generates new chunks, the surface depth is calculated for every column inside the chunk based on the minecraft:surface noise. This value is an integer, and when it is less than or equal to 0, the top block from the surface is replaced with air. Note that because surface depth is calculated per-column, every surface in the column is removed; that is, an identical erosion appears above or below another one if there is an overhang. The surface depth rarely reaches these values, eliciting the rarity of erosions. After the hole is generated, the floor is replaced with a stone block of the respective dimension, and the hole is flooded with water if it is at or below sea level. Erosion generation occurs before carver creation in the terrain generation process, meaning that caves, features, and structures can disrupt or even completely conceal them. As a consequence, ore blobs are commonly found in erosions, making ore more accessible to players on the surface.",

In the Overworld, players see themselves as a white pointer, and other players are displayed in different colors depending on the order in which they joined: the first player who joined - or the host - is light gray (looking almost identical to the regular white pointer), the second player is cyan, the third player is orange, the fourth player is light green, and so on. All players in the Nether are displayed with a red pointer, and all players in the End use a magenta pointer. If other players have a map in their inventory cloned from the one being looked at, they are displayed using white pointers.",

A variant of the ocean biome with dark indigo water at the surface. Like the cold ocean, it has a gravel seabed and squid swimming about. However, the water's surface is frequently broken up by patches of ice and large icebergs, consisting of packed ice and blue ice, and occasionally topped with snow blocks and snow. Strays, drowned, polar bears, and rabbits can spawn here, but dolphins can't. Salmon and cod may also spawn here. Like the frozen ocean biome, the only fish that spawn here are salmon and cod, squid may also spawn here, and the floor consists of gravel.

Polar bears, strays, drowned and rabbits can also spawn here, but dolphins can't. This rare biome consists of a mostly flat island and has mycelium instead of grass as its surface. Mushroom fields are always adjacent to a deep ocean and are isolated from other biomes, and they are typically a few hundred blocks wide. It is one of the few biomes where huge mushrooms can generate naturally, and where mushrooms can grow in full sunlight. No mobs other than mooshrooms, bats, and glow squid spawn naturally in this biome, including the usual night-time hostile mobs. This also applies to caves, mineshafts and other dark structures, meaning exploring underground is safe. However, monster spawners still spawn mobs, wandering traders along with their llamas can spawn, raids can still spawn illagers, the player can still breed animals and spawn mobs using spawn eggs and insomnia still attracts phantoms. Highland biomes are biomes with a higher Y-level. Rugged terrain and snow-covered peaks appear above the snow line. One of the three biomes that generate in the peaks of a mountain.

It attacks players, adult villagers, wandering traders, and iron golems by charging, biting, and roaring at them. A ravager can sometimes become stunned if its attack is blocked with a shield. Ravagers spawn starting at wave 3 as part of a raid. Depending on the wave, difficulty, and Raid Omen level, they spawn independently or with a pillager, vindicator, or evoker that rides them as a ravager jockey. An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3 and the extra wave (wave 4). An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3. A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in wave 5. 1-2 unridden ravagers spawn in the extra wave (wave 6). An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3. A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in wave 5.

Ravagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers and wandering traders within a 32-block radius. A ravager attacks by running toward its target and ramming with its head, dealing a knockback of 5 blocks. A ravager also attacks by opening and closing its mouths, biting its target. , ravagers may occasionally miss players when trying to attack, unlike other mobs. When a ravager sees a villager and an iron golem at the same time, it always prioritizes the villager, unless it is already fighting the iron golem. Ravagers do not attack pillagers who shoot them by accident, and do not attack evokers when their evoker fangs accidentally hit them. When a vindicator riding a ravager has been named \"Johnny\" it may attack the ravager while it is riding it, but the ravager does not attack the vindicator for any reason. When a ravager gets hit by a mob’s projectile while it is attacking the player, the ravager first attempts to kill who shot it, then goes back to attacking the player once the deed is done.",

      "chunk_text": "A minecart is a ridable vehicle entity that runs on rails and can be used to transport both players and mobs. Once placed, minecarts can be retrieved by them for some time. One attack from a pickaxe, sword or axe is enough for a minecart to drop in item form, provided the player's attack cooldown is reset. A minecart is also destroyed if it makes contact with a cactus, or if shot with a bow/crossbow. Critical hits are not applied to minecarts, although the particles suggest otherwise. Minecarts with command blocks can be given to the player with the command or through the Creative inventory under certain conditions; minecarts with spawners are available only via the command. Each drop 1 minecart when broken. A minecart can be placed in the same manner as most blocks, but only on top of a rail. Once placed, it may be derailed by pushing it off the end of the track. After this, it can be railed again by placing a rail directly below it or pushing it onto a track. Anything crafted with the minecart functions similar to a regular minecart, but cannot be ridden. Minecarts can be ridden by on them. Once inside, an external impulse may be needed to make the minecart start moving. The player can slowly move the minecart forward at about 8 blocks per second while riding it, by pressing . If the Minecart Experiments experiment is enabled, the gamerule can be used to change minecart speed. If a mob walks in front of a moving empty minecart, it is pulled into the cart. After rolling off of the end of a track, a minecart can be pushed around on open blocks. If a minecart is pushed onto or falls onto tracks, it \"snaps\" to those tracks. When riding a minecart, if the minecart lands on a rail, the player does not take any fall damage. Unlike with beds, there is no message above the hotbar or in chat for attempting to enter a fully occupied minecart. Players can exit the minecart by while riding it. When a player or mob dismounts a minecart, either by choice, by breaking the minecart, or by passing over a powered activator rail, the minecart tries to find a safe ejection destination for the player one block away.",
