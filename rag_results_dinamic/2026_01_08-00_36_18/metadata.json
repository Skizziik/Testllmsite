      "chunk_text": "See Damage reduction below to see how armor toughness affects damage calculation. Only diamond and netherite armor have armor toughness. The attribute is capped at 20. If commands are used to give the player armor with more than 20 armor toughness, or to set the player's attribute above 20, damage is calculated as if the player has 20 armor toughness. The following table shows the amount of armor toughness given by armor that can be worn by the player. ;Percent damage reduction Since without commands, the toughness of 20 is impossible, this can be simplified to: We can define from this equation a meaningful representation for total armor: This value of total armor represents the amount of damage of an attack required to \"break through\" the toughness of the armor (so that only regular armor points are used to mitigate the damage). Therefore, the formula above can be rewritten as: Note that even without toughness, there is still a \"breakthrough\" point of damage where the armor just starts being less effective. For armor sets that do not include any armor with toughness (no diamond or netherite), it is simpler to understand as: Therefore, another way to describe toughness is: A value that decreases the amount of reduction to the reduction of damage caused by higher amounts of damage. ;Percent damage reduction with Breach The percent damage reduction when attacked with a mace enchanted with Breach: ;Damage taken with Breach The damage taken when attacked with a mace enchanted with Breach: In tabular form (with a toughness of 0), damages are: These damage values are lower if a player wears pieces of diamond or netherite armor or has toughness added to the armor through commands. The following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself: Direct (melee) attacks from mobs and players. This includes the Strength and the Weakness effects and damage-increasing enchantments. Getting hit with an arrow, a shulker bullet or a thrown trident. This includes extra damage from enchantments (except shulker bullets). Getting hit with a fireball from a ghast or blaze, or a fire charge. Laser beam of a guardian or an elder guardian. Damage from Thorns enchantment, or spikes of guardians and elder guardians. Touching a damaging block (fire, lava, magma block, cactus or sweet berry bush).

      "chunk_text": "A lily pad is a plant block found in swamps, mangrove swamps and as fishing loot. It can only be placed on water or waterlogged blocks and can be stood on as a platform. Lily pads can be broken instantly with anything. They also break from collisions with boats. Lily pads can be found naturally on water in swamps, mangrove swamps, and wheat farm rooms of woodland mansions. Lily pads are obtainable through fishing, with a 1.9% chance per attempt. See fishing for more details. Wandering traders may sell 5 lily pads for 1 emerald. Lily pads can be used to make paths over water without having to build bridges or use full blocks. Mobs cannot spawn on lily pads. A lily pad is broken and drops as an item when water flows on it. Normal blocks can be placed on the bottom side of lily pads (from below). This breaks the lily pad (dropping it as an item), but leaves the block in place. Blocks can also be placed on top of lily pads, though the placed block appears to hover over the pad rather than rest on it. A lily pad can be used as a starting point for construction on an ocean surface without having to build up from the ocean floor (see also kelp for this purpose). Lily pads are the only solid block that doesn't prevent fishing treasure items from water near it. Lily pads can be placed only on top of water, ice or frosted ice. Lily pads occupy the block above water and are not part of the water block itself. Lily pads must be directly planted on the top of a water, ice or frosted ice block; unlike most blocks, targeting the side of a block that would result in it being placed on top of a valid block does not allow it to be placed. Similarly, targeting the sides or bottom of a block that can support a lily pad will place the lily pad on top. , lily pads can be placed on waterlogged blocks, including top half slabs. A lily pad faces a consistent direction that depends on its location; it is unaffected by the direction the player faces. Replacing a lily pad does not change the direction. , unlike most blocks entities can collide with, lily pads can be placed directly inside players. Placing a lily pad into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. In the inventory, lily pads have the color: . Otherwise, lily pads have the color: .",

This is why they weren't removed from the game. At a corner, when two perpendicular Edge Far Lands sections meet, the Corner Far Lands begin to generate. Unlike the infinite-length holes in the Edge Far Lands, the Corner Far Lands contains more normal terrain. This terrain is \"stacked\" on top of itself to create a bizarre sandwich with layers of ground and air, which gives it its nickname, \"The Stack\". Each layer looks like a giant floating continent, hovering over the next layer, which is shadowed. The majority of the generated world is Corner Far Lands, as the \"normal\" map (before ±12,550,821 mark) makes only the center of the world, and the Edge Far Lands make only its continued sides. The number of layers is not always the same and varies between five and seven (fusing together and splitting every so often). Layers can be grouped into three categories: Top layer: This layer exists at the absolute top of the map. Occasionally there can be a lower area that is not shadowed (this is technically a dry layer). The lower area is where a majority of the trees and passive mobs can be found, as the top layer receives almost all of the sunlight. Due to the lack of space, the area at the absolute top cannot have trees or mobs. The top layer tends to light incorrectly in day-night transitions. This is because the sunlight calculation does not work correctly when the entire chunk is blocked at Y-coordinate 128 in early versions. Dry layers: These generate slightly flatter than normal terrain and have grass, despite the darkness. At sea level, massive floating beaches can be found. Hostile mobs' spawn rate likely approaches the maximum due to being in the shadow of the top layer. Rarely, there are holes in the top layer that allow sunlight to reach these layers. Caves that have one of these layers as their \"surface\" can occasionally be carved out of dirt instead of stone. These layers have cave-like ceilings made out of stone, gravel and dirt. Flooded layers: Like the dry layers, these generate somewhat flat terrain, but it is comprised primarily of stone. Sand and sandstone appear down here, even down to 30 blocks below sea level.

As a result, most variant biomes were removed from the generator. , these biomes were merged with their normal variants, while , these biomes still exist but no longer generate. Minecraft biomes were generated in layer stacks. These layers generated specific aspects of Minecraft biomes, such as scale, rivers, varieties, and biome categories.

This map was then scaled and additional landmasses shuffled around to decrease the amount of ocean, twice, to reach a scale of 1 to 1024. Additional layers that decrease the amount of ocean were repeatedly applied until the ratio of land to ocean was about 50-50. Snowy biome categories were then assigned to a few spots of land, which was then shuffled around a final time to obtain a ratio of 33% ocean and 67% landmass. At this stage of biome generation, the final climate zones were applied as follows. Areas of dry landmasses were assigned to be a normal biome if it bordered a cold or frozen landmass. Areas of snowy landmasses were assigned to the cold temperature category if it bordered a normal or dry temperature zone. 1 out of every 13 landmasses was then marked as \"Special\", which would be used to place some of the rarer biomes in later stages of biome generation.

Most traps are considered to be mechanisms, though some are not classified as such. Traps are devices designed to trap or damage entities, often referred to as targets. Traps are often made up of 3 components: A lure, a trigger, and the damage source. In a simple landmine, the lure could be a base behind the landmine, the trigger a pressure plate, the damage source TNT. Not all traps have a lure, they may rely on chance or something else to lure the target. Feel free to add any ideas of traps you have here. Just follow the style guide and everyone will have new strategies to remove their enemies. A list of components for a good trap can be seen below: These components are a trigger that allows the rest of the trap to work. Pressure plates are commonly used to detect whether an entity or item presses on it. There are 4 variants (wooden pressure plate, stone pressure plate, light weighted pressure plate, and heavily weighted pressure plate.) Wooden pressure plates measure all entities and give out maximum signal strength. The most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect anything including items being thrown. Works best when paired with an observer. Stone pressure plates measure only players and mobs and give out maximum signal strength. The second most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect only a player or mob. Works best when paired with an observer. Light-weighted pressure plates measure all entities, and the strength increases as more entities are added. Useful if you want to detect a specific number of entities. Works better with only redstone dust if the pressure plate is for detecting entities and not players. Heavy-weighted pressure plates are similar to a light weighted pressure plate but they measure groups of 10 entities per redstone comparator output. Observers are most commonly used to detect whether a block state changes (ie: an ore trap). They are useful if you want to kill someone destroying a block in your base, a TNT lighting, redstone getting activated, containers being opened, furnaces turning on or off, etc. String, when connected to a pair of tripwire hooks or an observer, can detect when a player/mob steps through it or breaks it. It is also difficult to see. When a player/mob/item comes in contact with a string connected to 2 tripwire hooks, it will output a redstone signal.

The horse armor can be removed either by manually removing it from the armor slot or by using shears on the horse.

Leather horse armor protects horses from freezing in powder snow, but it does not negate other powder snow effects (e.g., falling through, inability to jump). If a horse dies while equipped with any horse armor, it will drop it along with any other loot upon death. Horse armor reduces incoming damage according to two values: armor, and armor toughness. The strength of incoming damage also determines the damage reduction of horse armor, as horse armor does not protect in a linear fashion, and instead drops off more and more as incoming damage increases. The total damage reduction of horse armor cannot drop off below 20% of its maximum. The following tables represent the damage reduction of the different horse armor types depending on the incoming damage, accounting for armor toughness: Unlike player armor or wolf armor, horse armor does not have durability.

TNT traps have many triggers; from pressure plates to observers to pistons to dispensers...and more! This is generally the cheapest way to kill the target, just have the enemy fall into a hole, preferably with pointed dripstone at the bottom. Pistons are often used, for example, to push a player into lava, push someone into a pressure plate, push someone into a block and suffocate them, and more. They are often used in some capture traps to continuously keep a player out of an area. Dispensers can be used to shoot out deadly objects like splash potions, arrows, tipped arrows, fire charges, lava, etc. Don't ever put anything of value in a dispenser unless you are trying to lure someone, or else they will just become rich off your trap. Nether Portals can be used to make traps that will affect players attempting to use them. You can place lava, TNT, hostile mobs, or a host of other deadly devices on the other side of the portal. Using TNT, lava, or pistons, you may also be able to break the portal after someone goes through it, leaving unprepared players trapped in the Nether.

Fire that naturally spreads into a valid nether portal frame activates the portal. Fire can spread onto and burn away any flammable block (or in the case of TNT, ignite it).

Circuits can be used to transmit redstone signals, perform operations with logic gates, store data, shorten or lengthen redstone signals, make clocks, and more. A useful distinction can be made between a circuit performing operations on signals (generating, modifying, combining, etc.), and a mechanism using the environment (moving blocks, opening doors, changing the light level, producing sound, etc). Making this distinction allows us to talk about the various circuits separately, and let all players choose whichever circuits are useful for their purposes. The machines controlled by redstone circuits can range from simple devices such as automatic doors and light switches to complex devices such as elevators, automatic farms, or even in-game computers. However, this article provides only an overview of redstone circuits as above. These can be used to control simple mechanisms, or combined as parts of a larger build. Each circuit type on this page has links to its own page, which provides greater detail about them and give schematics for multiple variations of each. Before working with any but the most basic redstone circuits, an understanding of some basic concepts is required: \"power\", \"signal strength\", \"redstone ticks\", \"block updates\", etc. Some relevant articles are listed below: The Redstone mechanics article provides more information on these concepts. The Redstone components article adds a list and description of all blocks that interact with redstone power in general. The Mechanisms tutorial complements this article with an assortment of mechanism designs using circuits described here. The Redstone tips tutorial gives general advice about building redstone mechanisms Trigger blocks are blocks that can power outputs. Most circuits are described using Schematic diagrams; some of these require multiple images to show one or two layers per image. See the Help:Schematic page for details on how various blocks and components are represented. The wiki describes circuit size (the volume of the rectangular solid it occupies) with the notation of depth &times; width &times; height, including support/floor blocks, but not including inputs/outputs. Another method used for describing circuit size in the Minecraft community is to ignore non-redstone blocks simply used for support (for example, blocks under redstone dust or repeaters). However, this method is unable to distinguish between flat and 1-high circuits, as well as some other circuit differences. Sometimes it is convenient to compare circuits simply by the area of their footprint (e.g., 3×4 for a circuit three-block wide by four blocks long), or by a single dimension important in a particular context (e.g., length in a sequence of sub-circuits, height in a confined space, etc.).",

Here you can add also buttons for [A,E], but I disclaimed them preferring a better arranging. The /b1\\-box outputs the first bit, the /b2\\-box the second, and so on. Now you see Key[i] with i=1..3, here you set the key you want to use. The first output of them is the 1-bit, the second the 2-bit and so on. You can set your key here with levers in binary-encryption. Use here the MUX-table upon, and for (0)h := (1111)2. If we enter the first digit, we have to compare the bits by pairs (b1=b1, b2=b2, b3=b3, b4=b4). If every comparison is correct, we set the state, that the first digit is correct. Therefore, we combine (((b1=b1 & b2=b2) & b3=b3) & b4=b4) =: (b*=b*). In Minecraft we have to use four ANDs like the left handside. Now we save the status to the RS-latch /A\\. The comparison works the same way for Key[2], and Key[3]. Now we copy the whole reset-circuit for Key[2]. The only changes are, that the manually reset comes from (not A) and the auto-reset (wrong digit after), comes from (C). The manual reset from A prevents B to be activated, if the first digit is not entered. So this line makes sure, that our key is order-sensitive. You can change the key in every digit, without changing the circuit itself. You can extend the key by any amount of digits, by copying the comparison-circuit. Dependencies from previous output only. You can decrease the amount of digits by one by setting any digit (except the last) to (0000)2. You can open the door permanently by setting the last digit to (0000)2 The bar to set the key will be get the bigger, the longer the key you want to be. The hard-coded key-setting is a compromise for a pretty smaller circuit, when using not too long keys. If you want to use very long keys, you also should softcode the key-setting. But mention, in fact the key-setting-input will be very small, but the circuit will be much more bigger, than using hard-coded key-setting. Not really a con: in this circuit the following happens with maybe the code 311: 3 pressed, A activated; 1 pressed, B activated, C activated. To prevent this, only set a delay with a repeater between (not A) and (reset B). So the following won't be activated with the actual digit. If you fix this, the circuit will have the following skill, depending on key-length.",

Pumpkins can be mined using any tool, but axes are the quickest way. When a pumpkin is pushed by a piston, it breaks and drops as an item. It cannot be pulled. Pumpkins naturally generate with the terrain in most biomes in the Overworld in the form of random patches. They require only grass blocks with air above (clear of any plants such as flowers or short grass), and can generate regardless whether that grass block has a layer of snow cover. Practically speaking, this means that the occurrence of pumpkins in stony or sandy biomes, or in grassy biomes with few clear grass blocks, is comparatively rare. Each chunk has a chance to generate a pumpkin patch, making naturally-generated pumpkins rarer than diamond ore. Pumpkins naturally generate in stem farm rooms in woodland mansions. 4 pumpkins generate naturally in woolen tents in pillager outposts. Pumpkins generate naturally as a pile (and in some farms) in taiga and snowy taiga villages. An enderman holding a pumpkin drops the block upon death. Wandering traders may sell a pumpkin for 1 emerald. Pumpkin farming strategies parallel those of melons. Planted pumpkin seeds grow a central stem that, after maturing, generates pumpkins randomly on adjacent vacant dirt-based blocks (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, pale moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots). If a pumpkin is harvested without also cutting the central stalk, another pumpkin generates afterward without requiring replanting or waiting for the stalk to mature again. Pumpkin stems take around 10 to 30 minutes to fully develop. They require a light level of 9 or higher to grow. Bone meal can be used on pumpkin stems to become fully-grown, but this does not produce a pumpkin immediately. A placed pumpkin can be made into a carved pumpkin by shears, which drops 4 pumpkin seeds and 1 . The targeted side becomes the face of the carved pumpkin, unless the top or bottom face of the pumpkin are targeted, in which case the carved side is on the side facing the player or south. Placing a pumpkin or carved pumpkin into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

These monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly invert, with natural terrain generation replacing the air/water up to the height limit and vice versa. Monoliths would generate in seemingly random locations throughout the world. They tended to generate around flattish terrain. They were caused by an error in the Perlin noise generator. Specifically, the hilliness of the terrain (the \"terrain scale\") was controlled by a noise map. The reciprocal of the value of this noise was then used as the intensity of a gradient applied to the terrain. Because the reciprocal is used, flatter terrain is caused by lower values (where the terrain bias gradient drops off faster), and hillier terrain is caused by higher values. Because the reciprocals of small negative numbers are very large negative numbers, the terrain abruptly changes when zero is crossed, causing the gradient to bias higher elevations toward being ground, and lower elevations toward being air. Thus, when terrain scale becomes negative, terrain generates upside-down, generating monoliths. This was possible in early Alpha because the noise map that determined terrain scale could return a negative value. (This may be the same 2d noise map used in Classic, where adding multiple octaves together could result in unpredictably high or low values.) The monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly generate up to the height limit, with natural grass block and ore generation. They could theoretically generate arbitrarily tall, being stopped only by the height limit, which - at this point in the game's development - was 128 blocks. The area below the monoliths was completely hollow, except for water generating at sea level and a layer of bedrock at the bottom, making the normal terrain seem like inverse monoliths.

They can also be designed to carry along a player and/or other entities, which may be riding in a minecart or towed along by honey blocks. They can also be crouching on honey blocks to stick onto them. The mechanics of such machines vary slightly between the Java and Bedrock Editions of Minecraft; This guide covers Java Edition and Bedrock Edition in separate sections. The key blocks for flying machines, more or less in order of appearance: Pistons are capable of pushing (and for sticky pistons pulling) up to 12 blocks. These can simply be arranged in a line in front of the piston, but slime and honey blocks allow carrying along blocks placed to all sides of that line. Various immovable blocks (notably obsidian and tile entities such as furnaces) provide limits and frameworks. Redstone Blocks: The key point here is while most other redstone power sources are partial blocks that get broken by pistons, this one can be pushed or pulled by pistons, so a machine can carry its own power source. Observers are sensors for both the environment and adjacent parts of the same machine, which can also turn a change in one part of the machines into power elsewhere. Slime and Honey blocks are similar: both can \"stick to\" other blocks at their sides, carrying those along with them when pushed or pulled by a piston. Their differences are as follows: They do not stick to each other. Slime blocks are solid blocks, which can take and transmit a redstone signal, while honey blocks are transparent blocks which cannot. Slime blocks bounce entities away from them, while honey blocks drag entities along with them (and prevent players or mobs atop them from jumping high). There are two main components of slime block flying machines: The engine provides the basic control and motion, based on the idea that a slime block pushed by a piston moves adjacent movable blocks, including other slime blocks, when pushed or pulled. However, each piston is limited to moving 12 blocks total. Extensions uses additional pistons to let tow along additional segments of a larger machine. Honey blocks can also be used to bypass the piston push limit by using adjacent slime block and honey block flying machines to divide the number of blocks in a structure among pistons. In Bedrock Edition, extensions are divided into leading and trailing types. Note that the schematics in this section use the usual building scheme where layer 1 (or occasionally layer 0) is the bottom layer.

For example, a slime block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which in turn has to push additional ground blocks in the direction of motion just as if they were being pushed directly by a piston. The same occurs when a slime block is moved by another adjacent slime block. For example, a 2×2×2 cube of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled as a single unit by a piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube. A slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons or a block that can be broken by piston ignores that block. However, if an adjacent block could be moved, but is prevented to by the presence of an unmovable block, the slime block is prevented from moving as well and the piston does not extend. Slime blocks' stickiness is unilateral, as such they can't be pulled by a non-sticky piston and they are not moved if an adjacent (non-slime) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2×2×3 structure of slime blocks may be pushed by a piston as long as no other movable block is adjacent to it. A piston cannot move itself via a \"hook\" constructed of slime blocks, but self-propelled contraptions can be created with multiple pistons. For more informations, see the article Tutorial:Flying machines. Honey blocks work like slime blocks when it comes to moving other blocks, however honey blocks and slime blocks do not stick to each other. This allows, by alternating slime blocks and honey blocks, to have redstone contraptions which make use of these sticky blocks stay side by side without interfering with one another.

Iron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs. Zombies target villagers within a 35- to 52.5-block radius (depending on regional difficulty ) or just 35-block radius , and they can always see villagers through walls. If a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it. Once a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead, the zombie is attacked or the player moves too close to the zombie. Any zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager. The probability depends on the difficulty: 0% chance in Peaceful (no zombies spawn) and Easy 50% chance in Normal 100% chance in Hard Zombies target wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls. The zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect. A zombie holding a weapon adds the weapon's damage to its normal melee damage. For example, a zombie holding an iron shovel on Normal difficulty deals from its punch + from the shovel for a total of .

Soul fire cannot be obtained as an item under any circumstances , though soul fire may be obtained as an item via inventory editing. Soul fire is immediately destroyed when broken. When shears are used to break soul fire, they don't lose durability. Soul fire drops nothing when destroyed. Soul fire naturally generates in the soul sand valley biome in the Nether. It exclusively generates on soul soil; it does not generate on soul sand within either the same biome nor in the nether wastes biome. Soul fire also generates in ancient cities. Soul fire can be placed on soul sand or soul soil using flint and steel or a fire charge, and explosions from sources like beds or ghast fireballs can ignite soul fire as well. Unlike regular fire, it can be placed only on the top of a block. When placed, a soul fire burns and does not extinguish by itself. Water that touches soul fire extinguishes it. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands. Players and many mobs burn when exposed to soul fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly. While inside a soul fire block, the fire inflicts damage at a rate of per tick, twice as many as with the normal fire (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second) unless the player or mob has Fire Resistance or a total Fire Protection of 7 or higher. When the player is on fire outside the soul fire block, they take damage at per second, the same as with normal fire. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful difficulty, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the soul fire (stored in a Fire tag shared by all entities). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by powder snow, rain, water, or a cauldron. Soul fire never extinguishes unless punched or when it receives a block update and finds there is no soul soil or soul sand below it. Punching or hitting a soul fire block extinguishes it, making the Fire extinguished sound (see below). Hitting soul fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on soul fire also extinguishes it.
