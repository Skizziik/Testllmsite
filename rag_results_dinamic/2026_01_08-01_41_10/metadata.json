The monument is constructed entirely from variants of prismarine and lit by sea lanterns. It includes a large central section flanked by two wings. Under the monument are 23 giant pillars that stretch to the ocean floor. The main entrance is located at the front of the central section. The base size of the structure is 58×58 blocks. Thus, the ocean monument (the location where guardians and elder guardians spawn) area is 3,364 square blocks. The central section consists of various types of chambers. The chambers are randomly generated; each monument has a different number of rooms (at least six) arranged in a unique manner. The chambers connect vertically and horizontally to the different parts of the monument, including the left and right wings. At the topmost room resides an elder guardian. Around the center of the central section lies the treasure chamber, a tall room with eight blocks of gold encased in dark prismarine. Occasionally, monuments contain one or more rooms with approximately 30 wet sponges on the ceiling. Sponge rooms have an opening only in the floor. Ocean monuments are not guaranteed to generate sponge rooms. One of the wings contains a large room with a small pillar at the center. The room contains a second elder guardian.

However, the output of the inverted detector is not a simple inversion of the daylight detector's output; it uses a much simpler algorithm that depends only on the internal sky light level. Specifically, it outputs a signal strength of 15 minus the current internal sky light level, where values over 15 or below 0 are taken as 15 or 0 respectively. This means that an inverted daylight detector actually outputs a strength of 11 at midnight when it's clear weather, if it has line of sight with the sky. The effects of shade are applied before inverting, so shade increases the signal strength when it isn't already full, and prevents it from reaching zero.

Daylight detectors can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.

Froglights are created when frogs eat magma cubes; different frog types create different froglight colors. Frogs spawn in groups of two to five in swamp and mangrove swamp biomes. Frogs have three variants: temperate, cold, and warm. The variant is determined by the biome the frog spawns in, both naturally and when growing from a tadpole. Frogs do not naturally spawn within cold biomes, but cold frogs can spawn naturally in a swamp or mangrove swamp bordering a cold biome, and a tadpole can grow up in a cold biome. Frogs drop when killed by a player or tamed wolf. is dropped upon successful breeding. On land, frogs slowly wander, jumping at random. They can jump up to 8 blocks high and take less damage from falling than most other mobs. They prefer jumping on lily pads and big dripleaves, and usually jump to places that are higher up. In water, frogs swim and move much faster. They generally swim upward and remain at the water's surface, but can swim downward if lured by a player. Frogs do not take drowning damage. Occasionally, they may croak and inflate their vocal sac. Frogs follow any player holding a slimeball within 6 blocks of them. Feeding two frogs a slimeball causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the frogs to become pregnant, similar to turtles. The pregnant frog then searches for a water block with at least one adjacent water block (flowing or source) with air above to lay their eggs, known as frogspawn. This spawn later hatches into several tadpoles, which subsequently grow into frogs. Unlike all other mobs with baby variants, the tadpole is treated by the game as a completely different mob from the frog. Furthermore, the biome in which the tadpoles grow into frogs determines their variant type, regardless of their parental variant type, a unique characteristic specific to frogs. Frogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth and eat them, whereupon the mob instantly despawns without a death animation. Frogs attack small slimes, which drop slimeballs when killed. Frogs also attack small magma cubes, producing a froglight block. When a magma cube gets targeted, the frog walks toward it at a faster pace before attacking.

Its shape is similar to a Conduit's power structure, with End stone white coloring on the outside and purple mottling on the inside. As the bullet flies towards its target it spins randomly. It follows the targeted entity along the X, Y, or Z axis and leaves trails of white particles. A shulker bullet that hits a mob or player deals damage and affects it with Levitation for ten seconds. If a shulker bullet hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, it retaliates against the shulker after its Levitation effect is removed. The shulker's projectiles also have entity data that control its movement. The bullet can be destroyed when it is hit with any item, shot with an arrow, or blocked with a shield. Specifically when attacked by a player using a melee attack, it has a larger hitbox than usual. It is also destroyed upon contact with a block or lava. , shulkers can be dyed in a similar fashion to sheep. a dye on a shulker gives it the color of the dye.

Additionally, the village center must be within a player's simulation distance volume.

These are approximate because they yield a cuboid volume, but the simulation distance volume is an octahedral shape based on taxicab distance.

Therefore, a small village does not regenerate an iron golem unless the village is expanded.

Once separated from the jockey it behaves like a regular nautilus, but burns in sunlight instead of suffocating while not in water. When an adult drowned spawns outside of river or frozen river biomes, either naturally or as part of a structure (i.e. an underwater ruin), and is wielding a trident in its main hand, it has a 50% chance to spawn as a zombie nautilus jockey, riding a zombie nautilus. Zombie nautilus jockeys thus spawn in dripstone caves and various ocean biomes; those that spawn in warm oceans will become the coral zombie nautilus variant, which apart from appearance is identical to the standard variant. In this state, the zombie nautilus's movement is controlled by the jockey. When the drowned rider is dismounted or killed, the zombie nautilus becomes neutral. It can then subsequently be tamed and ridden by the player. Zombie nautiluses do not spawn on Peaceful difficulty, like other monsters. je_player.java => player_or_pet when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

Unlike the nautilus, zombie nautiluses cannot be bred. When ridden by a hostile mob, as in the case of a zombie nautilus jockey, the hostile mob controls the movement of the zombie nautilus. When Vibrant Visuals are enabled, their eyes emit a surrounding glow that does not illuminate objects, just like the glowing eyes of other mobs such as endermen and drowned. As they are monsters, zombie nautiluses count towards the hostile mob cap, despite this, they are not targeted by iron and snow golems. Parrots can also imitate them, like other hostile mobs. Zombie nautiluses are neutral, attacking only when provoked. Like regular nautiluses, they attack by dashing into their target. Zombie nautiluses occasionally dash toward and attack nearby pufferfish. When dashing toward a target on land, zombie nautiluses can launch themselves out of the water and accidentally become beached on the land where they are unable to move.",
