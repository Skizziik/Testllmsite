A witch can choose to equip and drink a potion each game tick ( second) if it is not already drinking a potion. Drinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds and slows down its moving speed a little. The witch does not attack during this time. When the hitbox of the witch is 80% under water and the witch is lacking the Water Breathing status effect, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Water Breathing. When the witch is on fire or the last damage taken by it in the past two seconds was fire damage, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Fire Resistance. When the witch is not at full health, there is a 5% chance of drinking a potion of Healing which heals . When the witch is eleven or more blocks from a target and does not have the Speed effect, there is a 50% chance of drinking a potion of Swiftness. Witches still can be killed through suffocation, cacti, or wither roses, but due to their frequent use of potions of Healing, this requires constant damage output for 40–50 seconds. Additionally, witches cannot drown or die from fire unless they already are at low health. Witches usually die in lava, even at full health, when drinking a potion of Healing first instead of potion of Fire Resistance. When in a raid, if all the villagers in a village die or all the village beds are destroyed, witches jump and play unique sound effects in commemoration to their victory. , witches attack iron golems and snow golems or any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers, throwing harmful splash potions. , witches drink a beneficial potion, often an instant-health healing potion, when they are attacked by evoker fangs, illager mobs or harming potions from other witches and join an illager patrol if sufficiently near to the pillager, vindicator, evoker and illusioner patrol captain mobs.

It is very similar to a donkey, except it cannot breed. Mules do not spawn naturally, but a mule can spawn through cross-breeding a horse with a donkey. Mules cannot breed with other mules. 20% of mule spawn eggs produce baby mules. Mules are the offspring of horses and donkeys and are closer to (but not quite) the size of a horse. Their ears, coats, and manes are like those of a donkey, though mules' coats are darker and reddish-brown. Like donkeys, mules cannot be equipped with armor but can be equipped with chests. Mules cannot have babies, much like mules in real life. , when killed by a player or tamed wolf. If equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items, as well as any contents of the chest. Killing a baby mule yields no items nor experience. Similar to horses and donkeys, mules roam idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Mules turn to look at any player that comes near. Any mule, even a wild one, may be attached to a lead. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed mule, it rears and flails its front hooves. Mules can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate fall damage, unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Mules also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ( damage per block over the safe distance instead of ). If an entity is riding a mule, they receive the same fall damage as the mule. Mules, like most mobs, can ride in a minecart.

Skeletons and their variants Skeleton horses and zombie horses Zoglins and zombified piglins Zombies and their variants Mobs with the NBT tag. Armadillos are afraid of withers (and other undead mobs) and hide in their shell if a wither is nearby. If the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude. On Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target. The color of the wither's bossbar depends on the edition: dark purple or light purple . It appears whenever a player is within the vicinity of a wither. All withers display a boss bar on the screen, with a limit of five boss bars. A renamed wither displays its changed name above its boss bar. The fog around a player darkens when a wither is loaded. Additionally, the wither's side heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head. The interval for smaller heads is 2&ndash;3 seconds, while the main head's always 2. Upon noticing a mob or a player within 38 blocks, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls. The wither always tries to fly 5 blocks above, and within 3 blocks horizontally from its target. Each head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/players at the same time. The wither skulls try to fly toward the middle of the target's eye height and its feet vertically and the middle of its hitbox horizontally. The main head controls the wither's movement and fires a black wither skull toward its target every 2 seconds, with a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one. When the line of sight to its target is blocked, the wither stops firing wither skulls but still pathfinds toward the target. Side heads find a new target and fire black wither skulls toward the new target. The wither skulls from the main head spawn 3 blocks above its body vertically and the middle of its hitbox horizontally. The wither skulls from the side heads spawn 2.2 blocks above its feet vertically, 1.3 blocks offset from the middle of its hitbox horizontally.

      "chunk_text": "Projectile Protection Protection is an enchantment applied to armor that adds bonus damage reduction. Protection can be obtained from enchanting tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid, books obtained by fishing, monster room chests, librarian villagers, on armor dropped by various mobs, and non-village structure loot. Protection reduces the damage taken from all sources except for damage caused by hunger, a warden's sonic boom attack, the void or the command. This enchantment is capable of reducing damage from sources that normally ignore the user's armor value, such as falling or magical damage from status effects. The formula for damage reduction is for each armor piece, for a maximum damage reduction of 64% if all armor pieces are enchanted with Protection IV. Unlike the Blast Protection and Fire Protection enchantments, Protection offers no side effects outside of damage reduction. Damage reduction from Protection, Fire Protection, Feather Falling, Blast Protection, and Projectile Protection stacks up to an upper limit of 80% (see armor enchantments). However, it is impossible to reach this cap with the base Protection enchantment alone as it is impossible to obtain Protection V in survival mode. The protection enchantment is applied after the armor's damage reduction. If applied on wearable items that can't get the enchantment normally, such as a pair of elytra (using commands or an anvil in Creative mode), the enchantment works as usual. Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, and Projectile Protection are mutually exclusive. Attempting to combine these enchantments with an anvil deletes the enchantment in the upgrade slot and replaces it with the enchantment in the sacrifice slot. However, if commands are used to force two or more of these enchantments on the same item, the effects stack. But when the total of the EPF provided by the protection enchantments surpasses 20, the rest of these enchantments will no longer directly reduce the damage.",

An other portal is built as a vertical, rectangular frame of glowstone (4×5 minimum, 23×23 maximum), similar to a Nether portal. The four corners of the frame are not required. Adjacent portals can share glowstone blocks. An other portal cannot be built horizontally like an End portal. Once a frame is constructed, it is activated by water placed inside the frame. This creates portal blocks inside the frame, resembling a vortex. The water can be placed in any manner, including use of water bucket, dispensed by dispenser or natural spread of water. Other portals can be activated only in the Overworld; they cannot be activated in the End and custom dimensions. The water must be the last placed block in the structure—a water in an incomplete frame does not result in the portal activating upon the placement of the last glowstone block. When a player in the Overworld or the Nether stands in an other portal block for 4 seconds, the player is teleported 500 blocks in the air and Error 404 Terrain Not Found appears in the chat.

However, in Creative, the wait time is one game tick ( second) for the player to transfer between \"dimensions.\" Most entities can travel through portals, including mobs (except the wither and ender dragon), thrown items, and transportation without passengers (neither mobs nor player), including boats, minecarts and horses. Unlike players, other entities travel through portals instantly, and once they reach the other side, there is a cool-down time for 300 game ticks (15 seconds), in which they cannot go through any other portals.
