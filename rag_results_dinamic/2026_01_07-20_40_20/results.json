      "chunk_text": "While sneaking, a player is not detected while performing most actions corresponding to vibration frequencies 1, 2, or 3, such as moving, hitting the ground without taking damage, interacting with items, and shooting projectiles (although the projectile itself creates a vibration when it hits the ground). Wool and carpets have a special interaction with sculk sensors. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect the placed wool nor vibrations behind it. Specifically, if the ray joining the cube centers of the sensor block and the vibration source passes through any wool blocks, the vibration is occluded. If the ray passes diagonally through the edge between two blocks, either one or the other block may occlude it but not both. Sculk sensors are not able to detect footsteps or dropped items on wool or carpet, placement or breaking of wool or carpet, or wool or carpets dropping as items. Sculk sensors pass on the vibrations made by players to sculk shriekers within 8 blocks of the sensor. For example, an item dropped by a player triggers the shrieker, but an item dropped by a dispenser or from a broken block does not; a player flying around with elytra triggers the shrieker, but a bat flying around does not. Alarms can be blocked by wool placed in between the sensor and shrieker, similar to how wool can block vibrations from reaching the sensor itself. Sculk sensors emit a redstone signal in every direction (including top and bottom) when they are activated. The redstone signal emitted from the bottom powers the block below the sensor strongly, whereas in all other directions it appears as though the sensor itself is the strongly powered block. The strength of the redstone signal is to the distance the vibration signal traveled – the closer the vibration is to the sculk sensor, the stronger the redstone signal is, so it reaches the maximum redstone signal strength when the vibration is directly on top of the sensor. The distance is measured from the block at which the vibration occurred; moving within a block never results in a different strength. redstone_strength = max(1, 15 - floor(15 / detection_range * distance)) Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value. This value can be measured with a comparator.",

Most mobs will ride nearby boats, which they cannot control or exit on their own. Boats can be crafted with any Overworld planks; crimson and warped planks cannot be used to make boats. Boats can be retrieved by repeatedly hitting them until they drop as an item. In Java Edition, tools and weapons that deal more than damage can destroy a boat in one hit. Boats can be used for the transportation of players and mobs, sold for emeralds, or used as fuel. A boat used as fuel in a furnace lasts 60 seconds, smelting up to 6 items. A player enters a boat by it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities). Unlike beds, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat. A boat can be exited by or, , pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the \"Leave Boat\" button when using touch controls, or .

With touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear. The right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right. Pressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward. , boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation. A boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up. Bubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward. These mechanisms can also be used but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as follow upward stair-step currents.

Brown mushrooms also generate on the surface of a swamp, old growth spruce taiga, old growth pine taiga, or mushroom fields biome, along with anywhere in the Nether. Unlike plants, they are able to generate on top of nearly any block type. , brown mushrooms are commonly found in patches on the Nether roof, and alongside red mushrooms are the only blocks that can generate there. Brown mushrooms also generate inside \"mushroom farm\" rooms in woodland mansions. Fallen trees can have up to 2 mushrooms generated on them. Mining a brown huge mushroom has a chance of dropping brown mushrooms for each block mined. Shearing a brown mooshroom drops 5 brown mushrooms and permanently turns it into a normal cow. Shearing a bogged drops 2 mushrooms, both of which can be brown. An enderman holding a brown mushroom drops it upon death. Wandering traders may sell 3 brown mushrooms for 1 emerald. Brown mushrooms can be planted and grown on blocks that have a full top surface in light levels below 13 and not directly underneath the sky, unless on podzol, mycelium, or nylium.

Which block is chosen between the two corresponds to which direction the player was facing when they last interacted with the bed to set their spawn point; For example, a bed facing west will respawn the player on the south side of the bed if they are facing towards the north while setting their spawn point, and vice versa. If the player is perfectly aligned with the bed when the spawn point is set, the right side of the bed takes priority. Interacting with the bed again will still update which side of the bed is chosen for respawning, even if the location of the spawn point itself does not change. Once a side is chosen, if the block immediately on the chosen side of the head of the bed is obstructed, the next block to be checked is chosen moving in a clockwise (right side) or counterclockwise (left side) direction around the bed. If all of the 10 blocks immediately adjacent to the bed are obstructed, the block above the head of the bed is checked, followed by the block above the foot of the bed. The player is always respawned facing the head of the bed, the same as for waking up. For a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again. Specifically, when interacting with it, the location of the head of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works.

Normal compasses point toward the world spawn point in the Overworld. Using the command to change the world spawn can change where normal compasses point. If a compass or lodestone compass is on a lodestone, it becomes a lodestone compass that points toward that lodestone.

All lodestone compasses have an enchantment visual effect to distinguish them from normal compasses.

There are two causes for this: If the compass is in a different dimension to its target position (e.g. a lodestone compass is in the Overworld but its target lodestone is in the Nether), its needle spins randomly. Because of this, normal compasses only work in the Overworld (as their target position is the Overworld spawn point) and always spins randomly in the Nether and End. If a lodestone compass's target lodestone is broken, it spins randomly, even if the lodestone is replaced in the same position. The only way to 'fix' a 'broken' lodestone compass is to it on any lodestone to make it point toward it.

Credits: design from \"samnrad\" ( YouTube This video demonstrates two-way engine A above, with long slime-block arms for harvesting, which shuttles between two prepared docks. It can be triggered by placing a block atop the pistons, or by switches at the stations. The harvested crops are launched at some speed, so this design may be better for an enclosed farm. Extensions are mechanical parts of a fully-automatic flying machine used to push an independent part of a large flying structure. A single piston only can push or pull up to 12 blocks. Extensions use additional pistons to \"extend\" a slime structure by allowing more blocks to be pushed. A one-way extension has 2 parts: a normal piston in the rear, and a slime block (or more) with a power source in the front with space between them. Once the rear part with the piston is pushed, the piston is activated by a power source from the front part. It pushes the slime block (and thus the next part of the flying contraption and its extensions), which pulls the power source with it. The piston then deactivates and prepares for another push. Some simple engines are just made of looped extensions, such that, at any given time one piston is always powered (in these machines it is important to place the redstone blocks last). A two-way extension consists of an observer powering at least one sticky piston which pushes or pulls a part of the flying contraption. This is possible only in Java Edition because it's the only version where sticky pistons (upon receiving a short redstone pulse) can push a block and then retract quickly without pulling it back. This type of extension either continuously pulls or pushes depending on whether the part it's supposed to move is initially retracted. If the part is initially retracted and the extension is continuously pulled, the sticky piston continuously pulls the part. On the other hand, if the part is one block away (\"not retracted\") and the extensions is continuously pushed, the sticky piston continuously pushes the part. This mechanism necessitates a switch within the flying machine to independently retract and extend the extension before flight, because otherwise, the engine most likely cannot push due to the \"stuck\" retracted extensions adding extra load to the engine's pistons. A flying machine can be designed to not only carry a player along, but allow them to control the machine in flight, starting, stopping, or changing directions. Often due to lag, slime engines can bug allowing the player to fall through the machine.",

Romeo had the ability to take on different forms. The following titles are in order of first appearance. In Hero in Residence and Giant Consequences Romeo directly controlled one of the prismarine colossi. His golem in a box form appears to be a snow golem except he wears a top hat instead of a carved pumpkin and his bottom part resembles ice instead of snow. He also wears a blue coat with a light blue bow tie. In Above and Beyond, his admin golem in a box form is similar to the normal golem in a box form, with the exception of all that was blue is colored red or black. Also, his arms are icy golem arms instead of sticks. In this form he can create blue fireballs in a myriad of attacks. Romeo's Admin form has red hair, black and glowing red clothing, gray skin, and glowing eyes with yellow pupils and red sclera. Romeo also has Admin forms of other characters similar to his human disguises. Each resembles their respective character appearance, but with gray skin, black and glowing red \"champion\" clothing, and glowing eyes. After being defeated by Jesse and their team, Romeo lost his powers and enters his human form, with normal red hair and a beard, wearing a grey T-shirt and navy-blue pants. This form is the last he is shown to take, and potentially his final if left behind. Romeo is somewhat mentally unstable, as noted by Jesse in Giant Consequences; and is very capricious and erratic, as seen when he threatens to burn the Sunshine Institute to the ground simply because Jesse does not obey when he tries to pit them against Jack/Petra. He is also childish at times, such as when he taunts Jesse as he's/she's going to attack him (in the prismarine colossus form) and how he thinks that he can make friends through force and deceit.",

Earliest known publication: January 9, 2013 ;Analog repeater wire circuit delay: 1 tick per 14 blocks Signal strength can also be retained by using repeaters to repeat every possible signal strength at the correct distance from the output to convey the correct signal strength. It is the fastest option for long distances. A single segment of analog repeater wire (ARW) consists of exactly 15 repeaters connecting an input line to an output line. To connect multiple segments together without additional comparators, the segments must be arranged so that the output dust of the last repeater is the same as the input dust of the next segment (i.e., block B of the previous segment is block A of the next segment). This causes the segments to overlap in distance by one block and causes each segment to be offset to the side from the previous segment by two blocks. Variations: To keep the segments in-line, or to turn against the direction the repeaters are facing, raise the final repeater by one block and drop the next segment underneath it. Another option is to use a comparator and an opaque block between the segments, and alternate the direction the repeaters are facing.

So when it comes to telegraphs, use of buttons should probably be avoided entirely. Although they are similar to buttons in their general impracticality, the player could potentially utilize the pressure plate's unique ability to be activated by mobs. Multiple pressure plates could be positioned at different points of a cave, all of which could be connected to the one-way distress telegraph mentioned earlier. If any mob (only harmful mobs would spawn in a deep cave) stepped on one, it would trigger the distress signal, and players elsewhere would be alerted and be able to take action. The receiver is the means of displaying a message sent from another telegraph room. They can be either redstone torches or redstone repeaters. The redstone torch is a primitive, but compact receiver, displaying each pulse as it arrives from the sender. It does not record, loop or display the entire message, and it cannot be interpreted easily without a solid understanding of the language being transmitted. It is most common in the one-way and classic telegraph systems, where simplicity and instantaneous viewing are most valuable. In addition, they are the only type of receiver that can be wall-mounted. The addition of redstone lamps makes display a lot simpler by eliminating the need for an inverter. Redstone repeaters, in their simplest form, can be used like the redstone torch receiver. However, they cannot be sent pulses as quickly or be mounted on walls, making them much more useful when placed in lines of two or more. This allows the receiving party to view a larger portion of the message as it is received, or, if the line is long enough, the entire message. The speed at which each pulse is displayed and lost can be adjusted by right-clicking each redstone repeater. This will increase or decrease the delay on each repeater before it passes on the signal. Such a system can be looped, so that the message is repeated to the receiving party indefinitely (note that looping a received message requires an erasing device and a message no longer than the receiver can display at one time). In addition to being able to loop, redstone repeaters have the advantage of being able to be \"locked\" to a state. Thus, if a message is sent in a pre-configured pulse, it's possible to have a pulse preceding the message to lock the message in place in the repeaters, removing the need for a loop, and adding the possibility of a \"timed eraser\" if executed correctly. To lock a repeater in its current state, a repeater must power the side of it, then locking the current state. Pistons can be used in multiple bit receivers so that they look like dots and dashes.",

And if the non-stackable item is pushed, the output power level increases to 4. The hopper is held deactivated by the powered dust when the circuit is off, and by the powered dropper when the circuit is on. But, when the input turns off, there is a brief 1-tick moment when the dropper has just turned off, but the torch attached to it hasn't turned on again. This allows the hopper to activate for 1 tick, pushing an item back into the dropper. A hopper always pushes items from its left slots first, so the hopper pushes back the item the dropper pushed into it, rather than any of the 16-stackable items in its far right slot, allowing the circuit to reset itself. Variations: The player can remove one of the items from the dropper to create a 2-RNG with different power level outputs than the regular 2-RNG: removing the 64-stackable item outputs power levels 2 or 4, removing the 16-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 4, and removing the non-stackable item outputs power levels 1 or 2. You can add additional redstone dust leading from the hopper to a block next to it, and then down to the side of the comparator. This 2-wide variation keeps the comparator's output off while the input is off. With only three items in the dropper, all three output power levels are chosen with equal probability.

For example, with one 64-stackable item, one 16-stackable item, and two different non-stackable items, the RNG outputs power level 1 25% of the time, power level 2 25% of the time, and power level 4 50% of the time.

The swamp biome generates at temperatures of -0.45 to 0.2, meaning it generates at the temperate and cold biome temperature noise values. Swamps generate next to most plains, sunflower plains, flower forests, most forests, birch forests, dark forests, most taigas, old growth taigas, and some windswept savannas. Swamp biomes are usually found in flat terrain near sea level in regions with very high erosion values, and they also replace rivers in these areas. Swamps never directly border the ocean, with some other biomes generating between them instead. However, their water bodies are often connected to the ocean. Slimes may spawn in swamps during the night, exclusively between Y=50 and Y=70, making swamps and mangrove swamps the only places where slimes can be found above ground. Their spawn rate is affected by the moon phase, spawning most often during full moon and not spawning at all during new moon. Bogged add an additional threat to the night, thunderstorms, or caves, as their poison arrows can increase the danger of hostile mobs. Villagers that spawn in swamps get a unique swamp-themed look. While villagers have swamp-specific types, no village featuring exclusively these villagers can be generated. The only way for these villagers to spawn is either by being bred in a swamp, curing a zombie villager that spawned in a swamp, or finding a village that generated with some parts reaching the swamp.",

      "chunk_text": ", happy ghast spawn eggs have a 5% chance to spawn a ghastling. Happy ghasts fly around aimlessly and are passive to players and other mobs. Unlike most passive mobs, they do not panic when damaged. They follow players holding snowballs. They also follow players holding a harness, if they do not have one already equipped. They can also be leashed. Unlike regular ghasts, happy ghasts are not immune to fire and lava damage, and cannot shoot fireballs. Happy ghasts are unaffected by Speed. Happy ghasts can also be used to carry and transport entities in the air using leads. The player can attach a leashed boat, boat with chest, or specific leash-able mobs too large to fit in boats (horses, donkeys, mules, skeleton horses, zombie horses, camels, camel husks, and sniffers) to a happy ghast (both harnessed and unharnessed). Although only one lead is required to suspend an entity from a happy ghast, the carried entity appears to be hanging from four leads. If the happy ghast is harnessed, it also gains a unique visual design of ropes fastened to it. Any other leashable entity not listed above can also be leashed to the happy ghast, but they do not gain the 4-lead design, instead using only one lead. While the player is sneaking and holding an entity's leash, pressing the key on a happy ghast attaches the leashed entity underneath it. This secures the carried entity for safe transport while flying. Multiple entities can be attached this way at once, with there being no limit to how many. The leash can be removed later by using shears on either the happy ghast or the carried entity, separating them. Using shears on the happy ghast while carrying multiple entities cuts all leads simultaneously. While most mobs can safely sit in a boat or boat with chest while it is being carried, players cannot. When a player enters the boat, it becomes immovable by the happy ghast, eventually resulting in the lead snapping. Despite being a solid surface, walking on happy ghasts is completely silent and does not produce footstep sounds. Happy Ghast have entity data associated with them that contain various properties. Prevents the Happy Ghast from moving when greater than 0. Set to 10 when a player is less than 2 blocks above and decreases by 1 per tick otherwise. Movement resumes when it reaches 0.",
