If used normally, it deals 3.6 damage per second (DPS) or 5.4 if using critical hits, whilst a wooden sword deals 6.4 DPS. In , a Breach IV mace has the third-highest DPS and the highest damage per hit of all weapons versus entities wearing diamond or netherite armor. In , Breach IV maces have both the highest damage per hit and the highest DPS against entities wearing diamond or netherite armor, due to having no attack cooldown. A mace does a smash attack when it is after the player has fallen 1.5 blocks or more, regardless of the mace's current attack cooldown progress. The player must not be grounded or in elytra flight, and the fall height used in calculation is simply the starting height (Y coordinate) minus the ending height (Y coordinate). Successfully performing a smash attack without touching the ground resets the player's fall height to the height where the smash attack was performed, nullifying any fall damage. The player begins accumulating fall damage once again if they continue to fall. When a smash attack is performed, extra damage is dealt to the attacked entity based on the distance fallen prior to the attack.",

An observer requires a pickaxe to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. An observer is placed similarly to a piston. It observes the block that it is placed against. The texture of the detecting side is that of an observing face. As observers can detect the state of other observers, placing two adjacent observers, each watching the other, can make a fast and compact redstone clock. They send out a redstone pulse. , an observer detects shape updates coming from the block it's facing. This can involve changes in block states (like crops growing, for example), or the breaking or placing of a block. This makes observers differ from block update detectors in terms of what they can detect. , an observer acts as a block update detector and detects anything that causes a block update. The causes and propagation of block updates are different between Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. As a result, each can detect some kinds of changes that the other cannot. See the table below for a comparison. When it detects something, the observer emits a redstone pulse of strong power at signal strength 15 for 2 game ticks. The pulse can power redstone dust, a redstone comparator, a redstone repeater, or any mechanism component located at its opposite end. In Java Edition, the pulse is emitted with a delay of 2 game ticks. In Bedrock Edition, it is delayed by 2 game ticks as well, but it's sometimes delayed by 4 or 6 game ticks due to , a bug causing redstone delays to be incorrect when components are activated by world changes (which, in the case of the observer in Bedrock Edition, is the only way it can be activated), as opposed to pure redstone components ticking. Its timing can also be incorrect due to . Observers also emit a pulse after getting moved by pistons: this enables them to be used in flying machines. , however, moving an observer that is currently emitting a redstone signal will cause it to turn off instead. Because observers in Java Edition react to shape updates, they can detect some changes that a block update detector (BUD) would be unresponsive to, as opposed to Bedrock Edition where observers detect the exact same updates that any other BUD would detect.",

It can also be to either stop outputting a signal while its side input is receiving a stronger one (front torch off), or output a weaker signal based on its side input's signal strength (front torch on). A redstone comparator can be broken instantly with any tool, or by hand, and drops itself as an item. A redstone comparator is removed and dropped as an item if: its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed; water flows into its space; a piston tries to push it or moves a block into its space. If lava flows into a redstone comparator's space, the redstone comparator is destroyed without dropping as an item. 2-9 Redstone comparators generate in ancient cities. A redstone comparator can be placed on the top of any opaque block with a solid full-height top surface (including upside-down slabs and upside-down stairs). , a comparator can also be placed on walls and fences. For more information about placement on transparent blocks, see Opacity/Placement. The redstone comparator has a front and a back — the arrow on the top of the comparator points to the front. When placed, the comparator faces away from the player. The comparator has two miniature redstone torches at the back and one at the front. The back torches turn on when the comparator's output is greater than zero (the arrow on top also turns red). The front torch has two states that can be toggled by the comparator: Down and unpowered (indicating the comparator is in \"comparison mode\") Up and powered (indicating the comparator is in \"subtraction mode\") The redstone comparator can take a signal strength input from its rear as well as from both sides. Side inputs are accepted only from redstone dust, block of redstone, redstone repeaters, other comparators, and observers in specific scenarios. The redstone comparator's front is its output. It takes for signals to move through a redstone comparator, either from the rear or from the sides. This applies to changing signal strengths as well as simply to turning on and off. Redstone comparators check their power state before their scheduled ticks update. This results in redstone comparators not usually responding to 1-tick fluctuations of power or signal strength — for example, a 1-clock input is treated as always off from the side, and always on from the rear. This happens because the signal changes back to its original state before the redstone comparator checks its input states.",

However, they can still break placed entities such as minecarts, paintings, item frames, and armor stands. A copper sword can also be used to deal damage to mobs and entities by them. A copper sword has base damage , and can be enchanted to deal more damage. The following tables show how the Sharpness enchantment affects the damage dealt by the sword. A copper sword can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% a copper sword's maximum durability, rounded down.

They spawn in the Nether in lava oceans. The zombified piglin spawns with a warped fungus on a stick in its hand, instead of the usual golden sword. The zombified piglin can also spawn as a baby. The strider spawns wearing a saddle. on Halloween, there is a 22.5% chance for the zombified piglin to spawn with a carved pumpkin on its head, and a 2.5% chance with a jack o'lantern on its head. The zombified piglin and strider each drop mostly the same items they normally would (see and ). There are two notable differences: Instead of a golden sword, the zombified piglin has a chance to drop the warped fungus on a stick it is holding with random durability, with an 8.5% chance and a 25% chance . The strider will always drop its worn saddle when killed. The movement of the strider jockey is controlled by the zombified piglin. Because of the strider, it will move faster while in lava and slower when on land. Usually, they will not purposefully step onto land unless angered. The strider cannot be tempted by a warped fungus or warped fungus on a stick while being ridden by the zombified piglin, but it can be leashed. Like zombified piglins, strider jockeys are neutral towards the player and other mobs. They are angered when the rider or any nearby zombified piglin is attacked, resulting in the strider jockey attacking the aggressor via melee. They also pathfind towards and stomp on turtle eggs. Unlike players, the zombified piglin cannot “use” the warped fungus on a stick and force the strider to move faster. When the rider is killed, the strider becomes passive and behaves like usual. Additionally, the strider can immediately be ridden by the player due to spawning with a saddle already equipped. The saddle is dropped upon the strider's death. The strider’s saddle cannot be removed using shears while the zombified piglin is riding it.

      "chunk_text": "Variation (offset input): The circuit shown in the schematic to the right keeps the transmission lines in-line with each other, but reduces the signal strength by 1 in side movement in both input and output before continuing the transmission, so the circuits must be placed with only 11 dust between them to work. Placing a block behind each of the input repeaters and moving the input/output lines closer to the repeaters' outputs means that signal strength is lost only in side movement at input, allowing an additional dust between the circuits (and thus a more efficient transmission), but requires that the transmission lines alternate which side they run on. Earliest known publication: December 21, 2012 ;observer-rail instant two-way repeater 1×12×4 (48 block volume) 1-wide, silent, instant transmission speed: instant circuit delay: 0 ticks fastest clock signal: 2-clock two-way reset time: 2-clock Behavior: The powered rails initially hold powered. When any input is given, the rails act as a BUD and depowers, spreading the pulse both ways. All of this happens in the same game tick. Inputs can be added by creating a block update anywhere in the chain, and outputs added by adding an observer anywhere. Variations: Can be coupled to a line of droppers for an instant item line (Inspector Talon, 2022). Earliest known publication: Aug 26, 2021 For simple redstone structures, digital (\"on/off\") transmission is sufficient. For complex redstone structures, with banks of inputs or outputs, more sophisticated forms of transmission may be required, such as analog, binary, or unary transmission. When numbers are represented by different types of transmission, they are said to be encoded. An analog encoding in Minecraft (a.k.a. hexadecimal wire or simply hex wire) is a transmission that outputs the same signal strength it receives as input. Because power levels can vary from 0 to 15, an analog transmission can convey 16 states in a single wire. ;Analog comparator wire (ACW) circuit delay: 1 tick per 4 blocks The simplest analog wire is a line of redstone comparators. Like redstone repeaters, comparators can draw a signal from one opaque block and push it into another; thus, it is usually more efficient in resources and in signal delay to place comparators every four blocks. This wire is best used for short distances and tricky turns. The signal strength of an analog comparator wire (ACW) can be reduced or suppressed at some point along its length by feeding another signal into one of the comparators in subtraction mode. The signal can be overridden by feeding a stronger signal into one of the opaque blocks. Because the redstone dust is not adjacent to any power or transmission components, only opaque blocks, it does not configure itself to point in any particular direction. This also causes the dust to power any opaque blocks or mechanism components to the side of the analog wire.",
