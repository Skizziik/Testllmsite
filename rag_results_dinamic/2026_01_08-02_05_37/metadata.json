      "chunk_text": "When lightning strikes within 3–4 blocks of a villager, it turns into a witch. Villagers mate depending on the number of valid doors. If \"willing\" (see below), villagers mate as long as the population is less than 35% (: 100%) of valid doors, rounded down. The type of villager that spawns is independent of the villager's parents. A valid door is any door within the village radius where the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks in a straight line on one side of the door is not the same as the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks on the other side of the door. A space is considered to be \"outside\" if it has nothing but transparent blocks above it all the way to the sky. A census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village and within 5 vertical blocks (: no apparent height limit) of the center is counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and within the spherical boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they mate with each other and produce a child. Additionally, villagers must be \"willing\" in order to breed. After mating, they are no longer willing, and must be made willing again. Villagers can become willing by having either 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in one stack in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throw food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. Villagers may also become willing when the player trades with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. Most of the time, villagers becomes willing after the second or third trade. Green particles appear if the villager becomes willing by trading. This does not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however. Before Java Edition 1.8, willingness was not implemented. The only factor needed is enough valid doors. Each villager has a profession, which can be identified by their clothing. Villagers also have careers specific to their profession. The player can identify a villager's career by reading the title at the top of the trading interface. Below is a table listing the various villagers, with their careers in relation to their professions, as well as the IDs specifying these.",

      "chunk_text": "It is started by activating either of the observers on top (placing a block, flint-and-steel), and moves away from that corner (that is, it is also a two-way flyer). Credits: design from \"samnrad\" ( YouTube This video demonstrates two-way engine A above, with long slime-block arms for harvesting, which shuttles between two prepared docks. It can be triggered by placing a block atop the pistons, or by switches at the stations. The harvested crops are launched at some speed, so this design may be better for an enclosed farm. Extensions are mechanical parts of a fully-automatic flying machine used to push an independent part of a large flying structure. A single piston only can push or pull up to 12 blocks. Extensions use additional pistons to \"extend\" a slime structure by allowing more blocks to be pushed. A one-way extension has 2 parts: a normal piston in the rear, and a slime block (or more) with a power source in the front with space between them. Once the rear part with the piston is pushed, the piston is activated by a power source from the front part. It pushes the slime block (and thus the next part of the flying contraption and its extensions), which pulls the power source with it. The piston then deactivates and prepares for another push. Some simple engines are just made of looped extensions, such that, at any given time one piston is always powered (in these machines it is important to place the redstone blocks last). A two-way extension consists of an observer powering at least one sticky piston which pushes or pulls a part of the flying contraption. This is possible only in Java Edition because it's the only version where sticky pistons (upon receiving a short redstone pulse) can push a block and then retract quickly without pulling it back. This type of extension either continuously pulls or pushes depending on whether the part it's supposed to move is initially retracted. If the part is initially retracted and the extension is continuously pulled, the sticky piston continuously pulls the part. On the other hand, if the part is one block away (\"not retracted\") and the extensions is continuously pushed, the sticky piston continuously pushes the part. This mechanism necessitates a switch within the flying machine to independently retract and extend the extension before flight, because otherwise, the engine most likely cannot push due to the \"stuck\" retracted extensions adding extra load to the engine's pistons. A flying machine can be designed to not only carry a player along, but allow them to control the machine in flight, starting, stopping, or changing directions. Often due to lag, slime engines can bug allowing the player to fall through the machine.",

All donkeys spawn as adults when using spawn eggs, unless the spawn egg is on a donkey. , 2-6 donkeys spawn in plains, 1-2 in meadows and 1-3 in savannas. Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Baby donkeys start at half the size of adults and , get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, donkeys do not change appearance once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment. Donkeys are smaller than horses and sport long, erect ears. Their manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks. All donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails. Donkeys can be equipped with a saddle but cannot wear horse armor, and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items. experience orbs upon a successful breeding. , when killed by a player or tamed wolf. If equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items. They also drop the contents of the chest. Killing a baby donkey yields no items nor experience. Donkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. A donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near. Any donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves. Donkeys remain passive, even when hit. Donkeys can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate fall damage, unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Donkeys also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ( damage per block over the safe distance instead of ). If an entity is riding a donkey, they receive the same fall damage as the donkey. Donkeys occasionally emit a braying sound. Adult donkeys cannot ride a boat, though babies can.

Starting the engine of a flying machine often involves updating a piston or observer. Braking, on the other hand, isn't as straightforward to do in survival because a piston-immovable block must be present to stop the engine. A reliable braking method that was first popularized by SethBling is to attach a noteblock (or any similar redstone component movable by pistons) to the \"face\" of an observer that powers a piston. The piston is placed on the front of the engine, and since extended pistons cannot be pushed by other pistons, activating the note block at the right time stops the engine. By using sticky pistons instead of pistons for the braking components, they also become 2-way extensions. These can be used to carry extra blocks, such as holders for minecarts/minecart chests, passenger roofs, TNT duplicators, etc. Dimensions: 8x4 collapsed Materials: 4 observers, 10 slime blocks, 2 sticky pistons, 2 regular or sticky pistons, 4 note blocks.
