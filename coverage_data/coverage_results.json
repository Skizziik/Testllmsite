This can include:\n\n*   The player walking or moving around\n*   The player using items or tools that create vibrations\n*   The player attacking or fighting mobs, which can also cause vibrations\n\nWhen a warden detects these vibrations, it becomes increasingly agitated and adds anger to the player who caused the vibration.\n\nThe amount of anger added by the warden depends on the type of vibration detected. For example:\n\n*   If the vibration is from a projectile or minecart, the warden adds 10 anger.\n*   If the vibration is from another source, such as a player walking or using an item, the warden adds 35 anger.\n\nThe amount of anger added by the warden also depends on the level of agitation of the warden. The more agitated the warden becomes, the more anger it will add to the player who caused the vibration.\n\nOverall, the way a warden gets angry at players is through detecting vibrations caused by the player's actions.

When a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it emits a redstone signal in every direction (except the side with the amethyst stripe).\n4. To filter the vibrations detected by the sculk sensor, you need to power it with a redstone signal that matches the strength of the vibration frequency you want to detect.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n* Suppose you want to detect vibrations with a frequency of 5.\n* You can measure this frequency using a comparator.\n* Once you have measured the frequency, you can create a redstone signal with the same strength as the frequency (in this case, a strength of 5).\n* Finally, you can power the calibrated sculk sensor with the redstone signal. This will allow the sensor to detect only vibrations with a frequency of 5.\n\nNote that the strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal traveled – in other words, the closer the vibration is to the sculk sensor, the stronger the redstone signal will be.",
